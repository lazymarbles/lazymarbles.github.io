*abstract:* Artificial neural networks are machine-learning algorithms designed to analyse data without a pre-existing hypothesis as to any associations that may exist. This technique has not previously been applied to the risk stratification of patients referred with suspected deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Current assessment is usually with a points-based clinical score, which may be combined with a D-dimer blood test. A neural network was trained to risk-stratify patients presenting with suspected DVT and its performance compared with existing tools. Data from 11 490 cases of suspected DVT presenting consecutively between 1 January 2011 and 31 December 2017 were analysed, and 7080 for whom all components of the Wells' score, a D-dimer and an ultrasound result were available were included in the analysis. The data were broken into a training set of 5270 patients, used to develop the algorithm, and a testing set of 1810 patients to assess performance of the trained algorithm. This network was able to exclude DVT without the need for ultrasound in significantly more patients than existing risk assessment scores, whilst retaining very low false negatives rates. More generally, this approach may improve the analysis of complex data to support decision-making in other areas of clinical medicine.

**Journal:** *Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)*

*abstract:* While deep-learning algorithms have demonstrated outstanding performance in semantic image segmentation tasks, large annotation datasets are needed to create accurate models. Annotation of histology images is challenging due to the effort and experience required to carefully delineate tissue structures, and difficulties related to sharing and markup of whole-slide images.

*abstract:* Widely-prescribed prodrug opioids (e.g., hydrocodone) require conversion by liver enzyme CYP-2D6 to exert their analgesic effects. The most commonly prescribed antidepressant, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), inhibits CYP-2D6 activity and therefore may reduce the effectiveness of prodrug opioids. We used a machine learning approach to identify patients prescribed a combination of SSRIs and prodrug opioids postoperatively and to examine the effect of this combination on postoperative pain control. Using EHR data from an academic medical center, we identified patients receiving surgery over a 9-year period. We developed and validated natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to extract depression-related information (diagnosis, SSRI use, symptoms) from structured and unstructured data elements. The primary outcome was the difference between preoperative pain score and postoperative pain at discharge, 3-week and 8-week time points. We developed computational models to predict the increase or decrease in the postoperative pain across the 3 time points by using the patient's EHR data (e.g. medications, vitals, demographics) captured before surgery. We evaluate the generalizability of the model using 10-fold cross-validation method where the holdout test method is repeated 10 times and mean area-under-the-curve (AUC) is considered as evaluation metrics for the prediction performance. We identified 4,306 surgical patients with symptoms of depression. A total of 14.1% were prescribed both an SSRI and a prodrug opioid, 29.4% were prescribed an SSRI and a non-prodrug opioid, 18.6% were prescribed a prodrug opioid but were not on SSRIs, and 37.5% were prescribed a non-prodrug opioid but were not on SSRIs. Our NLP algorithm identified depression with a F1 score of 0.95 against manual annotation of 300 randomly sampled clinical notes. On average, patients receiving prodrug opioids had lower average pain scores (p<0.05), with the exception of the SSRI+ group at 3-weeks postoperative follow-up. However, SSRI+/Prodrug+ had significantly worse pain control at discharge, 3 and 8-week follow-up (p < .01) compared to SSRI+/Prodrug- patients, whereas there was no difference in pain control among the SSRI- patients by prodrug opioid (p>0.05). The machine learning algorithm accurately predicted the increase or decrease of the discharge, 3-week and 8-week follow-up pain scores when compared to the pre-operative pain score using 10-fold cross validation (mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.87, 0.81, and 0.69, respectively). Preoperative pain, surgery type, and opioid tolerance were the strongest predictors of postoperative pain control. We provide the first direct clinical evidence that the known ability of SSRIs to inhibit prodrug opioid effectiveness is associated with worse pain control among depressed patients. Current prescribing patterns indicate that prescribers may not account for this interaction when choosing an opioid. The study results imply that prescribers might instead choose direct acting opioids (e.g. oxycodone or morphine) in depressed patients on SSRIs.

**Authors:** *McMaster Christopher, Liew David, Keith Claire, Aminian Parnaz, Frauman Albert*

**Journal:** *Drug safety*

*abstract:* Adverse drug reaction (ADR) detection in hospitals is heavily reliant on spontaneous reporting by clinical staff, with studies in the literature pointing to high rates of underreporting [1]. International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) codes have been used in epidemiological studies of ADRs and offer the potential for automated ADR detection systems.

**Journal:** *Brain structure & function*

*abstract:* The critical role of the hippocampus in human learning has been illuminated by neuroimaging studies that increasingly improve the detail with which hippocampal function is understood. However, the hippocampal information developed with different types of imaging technologies is seldom integrated within a single investigation of the neural changes that occur during learning. Here, we show three different ways in which a small hippocampal region changes as the structures and names of a set of organic compounds are being learned, reflecting changes at the microstructural, informational, and cortical network levels. The microstructural changes are sensed using measures of water diffusivity. The informational changes are assessed using machine learning of the neural representations of organic compounds as they are encoded in the fMRI-measured activation levels of a set of hippocampal voxels. The changes in cortical networks are measured in terms of the functional connectivity between hippocampus and parietal regions. The co-location of these three hippocampal changes reflects that structure's involvement in learning at all three levels of explanation, consistent with the multiple ways in which learning brings about neural change.

**Journal:** *Journal of medical Internet research*

*abstract:* Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are common and are the underlying cause of over a million serious injuries and deaths each year. The most familiar method to detect ADRs is relying on spontaneous reports. Unfortunately, the low reporting rate of spontaneous reports is a serious limitation of pharmacovigilance.

**Journal:** *ACS nano*

*abstract:* The extracellular environment is a complex medium in which cells secrete and consume metabolites. Molecular gradients are thereby created near cells, triggering various biological and physiological responses. However, investigating these molecular gradients remain challenging since current tools are ill-suited, provide poor temporal and special resolution while also being destructive. Herein, we report the development and application of a machine learning approach in combination with a surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) nanoprobe to measure simultaneously the gradients of at least eight metabolites in vitro nearby different cell lines. We found significant increase in secretion, or consumption of lactate, glucose, ATP, glutamine and urea within 20 microns from the cells surface compared to the bulk. We also observed that cancerous cells (HeLa) compared to fibroblast (REF52) have a greater glycolytic rate, expected by this phenotype. Endothelial (HUVEC) and HeLa cells exhibited significant increase in extracellular ATP compared to the control, shining light on the implication of extracellular ATP within the cancer local environment. Machine-learning driven SERS optophysiology is generally applicable to metabolites involved in cellular processes, providing a general platform to study cell biology.

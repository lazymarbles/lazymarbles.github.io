*abstract:* Resistance co-occurrence within first-line anti-tuberculosis (TB) drugs is a common phenomenon. Existing methods based on genetic data analysis of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) have been able to predict resistance of MTB to individual drugs, but have not considered the resistance co-occurrence and cannot capture latent structure of genomic data that corresponds to lineages.

## 13. Predicting neurological recovery with Canonical Autocorrelation Embeddings.


*Journal: PloS one* *Publication Date: 2019*

*abstract:* Early prediction of the potential for neurological recovery after resuscitation from cardiac arrest is difficult but important. Currently, no clinical finding or combination of findings are sufficient to accurately predict or preclude favorable recovery of comatose patients in the first 24 to 48 hours after resuscitation. Thus, life-sustaining therapy is often continued for several days in patients whose irrecoverable injury is not yet recognized. Conversely, early withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy increases mortality among patients who otherwise might have gone on to recover. In this work, we present Canonical Autocorrelation Analysis (CAA) and Canonical Autocorrelation Embeddings (CAE), novel methods suitable for identifying complex patterns in high-resolution multivariate data often collected in highly monitored clinical environments such as intensive care units. CAE embeds sets of datapoints onto a space that characterizes their latent correlation structures and allows direct comparison of these structures through the use of a distance metric. The methodology may be particularly suitable when the unit of analysis is not just an individual datapoint but a dataset, as for instance in patients for whom physiological measures are recorded over time, and where changes of correlation patterns in these datasets are informative for the task at hand. We present a proof of concept to illustrate the potential utility of CAE by applying it to characterize electroencephalographic recordings from 80 comatose survivors of cardiac arrest, aiming to identify patients who will survive to hospital discharge with favorable functional recovery. Our results show that with very low probability of making a Type 1 error, we are able to identify 32.5% of patients who are likely to have a good neurological outcome, some of whom have otherwise unfavorable clinical characteristics. Importantly, some of these had 5% predicted chance of favorable recovery based on initial illness severity measures alone. Providing this information to support clinical decision-making could motivate the continuation of life-sustaining therapies for these patients.

## 14. In silico identification of critical proteins associated with learning process and immune system for Down syndrome.


*Journal: PloS one* *Publication Date: 2019*

*abstract:* Understanding expression levels of proteins and their interactions is a key factor to diagnose and explain the Down syndrome which can be considered as the most prevalent reason of intellectual disability in human beings. In the previous studies, the expression levels of 77 proteins obtained from normal genotype control mice and from trisomic Ts65Dn mice have been analyzed after training in contextual fear conditioning with and without injection of the memantine drug using statistical methods and machine learning techniques. Recent studies have also pointed out that there may be a linkage between the Down syndrome and the immune system. Thus, the research presented in this paper aim at in silico identification of proteins which are significant to the learning process and the immune system and to derive the most accurate model for classification of mice. In this paper, the features are selected by implementing forward feature selection method after preprocessing step of the dataset. Later, deep neural network, gradient boosting tree, support vector machine and random forest classification methods are implemented to identify the accuracy. It is observed that the selected feature subsets not only yield higher accuracy classification results but also are composed of protein responses which are important for the learning and memory process and the immune system.

## 15. Learning the sequence of influenza A genome assembly during viral replication using point process models and fluorescence in situ hybridization.


*Journal: PLoS computational biology* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-28*

[http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006199](http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006199){: .btn}

*abstract:* Within influenza virus infected cells, viral genomic RNA are selectively packed into progeny virions, which predominantly contain a single copy of 8 viral RNA segments. Intersegmental RNA-RNA interactions are thought to mediate selective packaging of each viral ribonucleoprotein complex (vRNP). Clear evidence of a specific interaction network culminating in the full genomic set has yet to be identified. Using multi-color fluorescence in situ hybridization to visualize four vRNP segments within a single cell, we developed image-based models of vRNP-vRNP spatial dependence. These models were used to construct likely sequences of vRNP associations resulting in the full genomic set. Our results support the notion that selective packaging occurs during cytoplasmic transport and identifies the formation of multiple distinct vRNP sub-complexes that likely form as intermediate steps toward full genomic inclusion into a progeny virion. The methods employed demonstrate a statistically driven, model based approach applicable to other interaction and assembly problems.

*abstract:* Developing predictive modeling frameworks of potential cytotoxicity of engineered nanoparticles is critical for environmental and health risk analysis. The complexity and the heterogeneity of available data on potential risks of nanoparticles, in addition to interdependency of relevant influential attributes, makes it challenging to develop a generalization of nanoparticle toxicity behavior. Lack of systematic approaches to investigate these risks further adds uncertainties and variability to the body of literature and limits generalizability of existing studies. Here, we developed a rigorous approach for assembling published evidence on cytotoxicity of several organic and inorganic nanoparticles and unraveled hidden relationships that were not targeted in the original publications. We used a machine learning approach that employs decision trees together with feature selection algorithms ( e.g., Gain ratio) to analyze a set of published nanoparticle cytotoxicity sample data (2896 samples). The specific studies were selected because they specified nanoparticle-, cell-, and screening method-related attributes. The resultant decision-tree classifiers are sufficiently simple, accurate, and with high prediction power and should be widely applicable to a spectrum of nanoparticle cytotoxicity settings. Among several influential attributes, we show that the cytotoxicity of nanoparticles is primarily predicted from the nanoparticle material chemistry, followed by nanoparticle concentration and size, cell type, and cytotoxicity screening indicator. Overall, our study indicates that following rigorous and transparent methodological experimental approaches, in parallel to continuous addition to this data set developed using our approach, will offer higher predictive power and accuracy and uncover hidden relationships. Results obtained in this study help focus future studies to develop nanoparticles that are safe by design.

*abstract:* High-performance flexible strain and pressure sensors are important components of the systems for human motion detection, human-machine interaction, soft robotics, electronic skin, etc., which are envisioned as the key technologies for applications in future human healthcare monitoring and artificial intelligence. In recent years, highly flexible and wearable strain/pressure sensors have been developed based on various materials/structures and transduction mechanisms. Piezoresistive three-dimensional (3D) monolithic conductive sponge, the resistance of which changes upon external pressure or stimuli, has emerged as a forefront material for flexible and wearable pressure sensor due to its excellent sensor performance, facile fabrication, and simple circuit integration. This review focuses on the rapid development of the piezoresistive pressure sensors based on 3D conductive sponges. Various piezoresistive conductive sponges are categorized into four different types and their material and structural characteristics are summarized. Methods for preparation of the 3D conductive sponges are reviewed, followed by examples of device performance and selected applications. The review concludes with a critical reflection of the current status and challenges. Prospects of the 3D conductive sponge for flexible and wearable pressure sensor are discussed.

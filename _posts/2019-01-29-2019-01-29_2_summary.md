**Journal:** *Chemical biology & drug design*

*abstract:* Data mining methods based on machine learning play an increasingly important role in drug design and discovery. In the current work, eight machine learning methods including decision trees, k-Nearest neighbor, support vector machines, random forests, extremely randomized trees, AdaBoost, gradient boosting trees, and XGBoost were evaluated comprehensively through a case study of ACC inhibitor data sets. Internal and external data sets were employed for cross-validation of the eight machine learning methods. Results showed that the extremely randomized trees model performed best and was adopted as the first step of virtual screening. Together with structure-based virtual screening in the second step, this combined strategy obtained desirable results. This work indicates that the combination of machine learning methods with traditional structure-based virtual screening can effectively strengthen the ability in finding potential hits from large compound database for a given target.

#### [22. Chalcogenide Phase Change Material for Active Terahertz Photonics.](https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.201808157){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Pitchappa Prakash, Kumar Abhishek, Prakash Saurav, Jani Hariom, Venkatesan Thirumalai, Singh Ranjan*

**Journal:** *Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)*

*abstract:* The strikingly contrasting optical properties of various phases of chalcogenide phase change materials (PCM) has recently led to the development of novel photonic devices such as all-optical non-von Neumann memory, nanopixel displays, color rendering, and reconfigurable nanoplasmonics. However, the exploration of chalcogenide photonics is currently limited to optical and infrared frequencies. Here, a phase change material integrated terahertz metamaterial for multilevel nonvolatile resonance switching with spatial and temporal selectivity is demonstrated. By controlling the crystalline proportion of the PCM film, multilevel, non-volatile, terahertz resonance switching states with long retention time at zero hold power are realized. Spatially selective reconfiguration at sub-metamaterial scale is shown by delivering electrical stimulus locally through designer interconnect architecture. The PCM metamaterial also features ultrafast optical modulation of terahertz resonances with tunable switching speed based on the crystalline order of the PCM film. The multilevel nonvolatile, spatially selective, and temporally tunable PCM metamaterial will provide a pathway toward development of novel and disruptive terahertz technologies including spatio-temporal terahertz modulators for high speed wireless communication, neuromorphic photonics, and machine-learning metamaterials.

#### [23. In silico prediction of chemical reproductive toxicity using machine learning.](https://doi.org/10.1002/jat.3772){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Jiang Changsheng, Yang Hongbin, Di Peiwen, Li Weihua, Tang Yun, Liu Guixia*

**Journal:** *Journal of applied toxicology : JAT*

*abstract:* Reproductive toxicity is an important regulatory endpoint in health hazard assessment. Because the in vivo tests are expensive, time consuming and require a large number of animals, which must be killed, in silico approaches as the alternative strategies have been developed to assess the potential reproductive toxicity (reproductive toxicity) of chemicals. Some prediction models for reproductive toxicity have been developed, but most of them were built only based on one single endpoint such as embryo teratogenicity; therefore, these models may not provide reliable predictions for toxic chemicals with other endpoints, such as sperm reduction or gonadal dysgenesis. Here, a total of 1823 chemicals for reproductive toxicity characterized by multiple endpoints were used to develop structure-activity relationship models by six machine-learning approaches with nine molecular fingerprints. Among the models, MACCSFP-SVM model has the best performance for the external validation set (area under the curve = 0.900, classification accuracy = 0.836). The applicability domain was analyzed, and a rational boundary was found to distinguish inaccurate predictions and accurate predictions. Moreover, several structural alerts for characterizing reproductive toxicity were identified using the information gain combining substructure frequency analysis. Our results would be helpful for the prediction of the reproductive toxicity of chemicals.

#### [24. Geoffrey: An Automated Schedule System on a Social Robot for the Intellectually Challenged.](https://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/4350272){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Cruz Edmanuel, Escalona Félix, Bauer Zuria, Cazorla Miguel, García-Rodríguez José, Martinez-Martin Ester, Rangel José Carlos, Gomez-Donoso Francisco*

**Journal:** *Computational intelligence and neuroscience*

*abstract:* The accelerated growth of the percentage of elder people and persons with brain injury-related conditions and who are intellectually challenged are some of the main concerns of the developed countries. These persons often require special cares and even almost permanent overseers that help them to carry out diary tasks. With this issue in mind, we propose an automated schedule system which is deployed on a social robot. The robot keeps track of the tasks that the patient has to fulfill in a diary basis. When a task is triggered, the robot guides the patient through its completion. The system is also able to detect if the steps are being properly carried out or not, issuing alerts in that case. To do so, an ensemble of deep learning techniques is used. The schedule is customizable by the carers and authorized relatives. Our system could enhance the quality of life of the patients and improve their self-autonomy. The experimentation, which was supervised by the ADACEA foundation, validates the achievement of these goals.

**Authors:** *Drumond Thalita F, Viéville Thierry, Alexandre Frédéric*

**Journal:** *Frontiers in computational neuroscience*

*abstract:* Deep artificial neural networks are feed-forward architectures capable of very impressive performances in diverse domains. Indeed stacking multiple layers allows a hierarchical composition of local functions, providing efficient compact mappings. Compared to the brain, however, such architectures are closer to a single pipeline and require huge amounts of data, while concrete cases for either human or machine learning systems are often restricted to not-so-big data sets. Furthermore, interpretability of the obtained results is a key issue: since deep learning applications are increasingly present in society, it is important that the underlying processes be accessible and understandable to every one. In order to target these challenges, in this contribution we analyze how considering prototypes in a rather generalized sense (with respect to the state of the art) allows to reasonably work with small data sets while providing an interpretable view of the obtained results. Some mathematical interpretation of this proposal is discussed. Sensitivity to hyperparameters is a key issue for reproducible deep learning results, and is carefully considered in our methodology. Performances and limitations of the proposed setup are explored in details, under different hyperparameter sets, in an analogous way as biological experiments are conducted. We obtain a rather simple architecture, easy to explain, and which allows, combined with a standard method, to target both performances and interpretability.

#### [27. Machine Learning Models for Multiparametric Glioma Grading With Quantitative Result Interpretations.](https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2018.01046){: .btn}

**Journal:** *Frontiers in neuroscience*

*abstract:* Gliomas are the most common primary malignant brain tumors in adults. Accurate grading is crucial as therapeutic strategies are often disparate for different grades and may influence patient prognosis. This study aims to provide an automated glioma grading platform on the basis of machine learning models. In this paper, we investigate contributions of multi-parameters from multimodal data including imaging parameters or features from the Whole Slide images (WSI) and the proliferation marker Ki-67 for automated brain tumor grading. For each WSI, we extract both visual parameters such as morphology parameters and sub-visual parameters including first-order and second-order features. On the basis of machine learning models, our platform classifies gliomas into grades II, III, and IV. Furthermore, we quantitatively interpret and reveal the important parameters contributing to grading with the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) algorithm. The quantitative analysis and explanation may assist clinicians to better understand the disease and accordingly to choose optimal treatments for improving clinical outcomes. The performance of our grading model was evaluated with cross-validation, which randomly divided the patients into non-overlapping training and testing sets and repeatedly validated the model on the different testing sets. The primary results indicated that this modular platform approach achieved the highest grading accuracy of 0.90 ± 0.04 with support vector machine (SVM) algorithm, with grading accuracies of 0.91 ± 0.08, 0.90 ± 0.08, and 0.90 ± 0.07 for grade II, III, and IV gliomas, respectively.

*abstract:* Automatic algorithms for disease diagnosis are being thoroughly researched for use in clinical settings. They usually rely on pre-identified biomarkers to highlight the existence of certain problems. However, finding such biomarkers for neurodevelopmental disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has challenged researchers for many years. With enough data and computational power, machine learning (ML) algorithms can be used to interpret the data and extract the best biomarkers from thousands of candidates. In this study, we used the fMRI data of 816 individuals enrolled in the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) to introduce a new biomarker extraction pipeline for ASD that relies on the use of graph theoretical metrics of fMRI-based functional connectivity to inform a support vector machine (SVM). Furthermore, we split the dataset into 5 age groups to account for the effect of aging on functional connectivity. Our methodology achieved better results than most state-of-the-art investigations on this dataset with the best model for the >30 years age group achieving an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 95, 97, and 95%, respectively. Our results suggest that measures of centrality provide the highest contribution to the classification power of the models.

**Authors:** *Peña-Nogales Óscar, Ellmore Timothy M, de Luis-García Rodrigo, Suescun Jessika, Schiess Mya C, Giancardo Luca*

**Journal:** *Frontiers in neuroscience*

*abstract:* Parkinson's disease is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder in the Western world. It is estimated that the neuronal loss related to Parkinson's disease precedes the clinical diagnosis by more than 10 years (prodromal phase) which leads to a subtle decline that translates into non-specific clinical signs and symptoms. By leveraging diffusion magnetic resonance imaging brain (MRI) data evaluated longitudinally, at least at two different time points, we have the opportunity of detecting and measuring brain changes early on in the neurodegenerative process, thereby allowing early detection and monitoring that can enable development and testing of disease modifying therapies. In this study, we were able to define a longitudinal degenerative Parkinson's disease progression pattern using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging connectivity information. Such pattern was discovered using a

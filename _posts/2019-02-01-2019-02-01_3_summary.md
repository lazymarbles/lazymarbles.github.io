**Journal:** *Anatomical sciences education*

*abstract:* Neuroanatomy has been deemed crucial for clinical neurosciences. It has been one of the most challenging parts of the anatomical curriculum and is one of the causes of "neurophobia", whose main implication is a negative influence on the choice of neurology in the near future. In the last decades, several educational strategies have been identified to improve the skills of students and to promote a deep learning. The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature to identify the most effective method/s to teach human neuroanatomy. The search was restricted to publications written in English language and to articles describing teaching tools in undergraduate medical courses from January 2006 through December 2017. The primary outcome was the observation of improvement of anatomical knowledge in undergraduate medical students. Secondary outcomes were the amelioration of long-term retention knowledge and the grade of satisfaction of students. Among 18 selected studies, 44.4% have used three-dimensional (3D) teaching tools, 16.6% near peer teaching tool, 5.55% flipped classroom tool, 5.55% applied neuroanatomy elective course, 5.55% equivalence-based instruction-rote learning, 5.55% mobile augmented reality, 5.55% inquiry-based clinical case, 5.55% cadaver dissection, and 5.55% Twitter. The high in-between study heterogeneity was the main issue to identify the most helpful teaching tool to improve neuroanatomical knowledge among medical students. Data from this study suggest that a combination of multiple pedagogical resources seems to be the more advantageous for teaching neuroanatomy. This article is protected by copyright.

#### [22. Learning-in-Templates Enables Accelerated Discovery and Synthesis of New Stable Double-Perovskites.](https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/jacs.8b13420){: .btn}

**Journal:** *Journal of the American Chemical Society*

*abstract:* In the past three years, Machine Learning (ML) in combination with Density Functional Theory (DFT) has enabled computational screening of compounds with the goal of accelerated materials discovery. Unfortunately, DFT+ML has, until now, either relied on knowledge of the atomic positions at DFT energy minima, which are a priori unknown, or has been limited to chemical spaces of modest size. Here we report a strategy that we term Learning-in-Templates (LiT) wherein we first define a series of space group and stoichiometry templates corresponding to hypothesized compounds and, orthogonally, we allow any list of atoms to take on any template. The LiT approach is deployed in combination with previously-established position-dependent representations and performs best with the representations that rely least on the atomic positions. Since the positions of the atoms in templates are known and do not change, LiT enables us to infer the properties of interest directly; additionally, LiT allows working with increased chemical spaces, since the same elements can take on a large number of templates. Only by using LiT were we able to span a 5x106 double perovskite compounds and achieve an acceleration factor of 700 compared to brute-force DFT, allowing us to predict never-before-screened compounds. Our findings motivated us to synthesize a new BaCuyTa

*abstract:* In the last decades, laparoscopic surgery has become the gold standard in patients with colorectal cancer. To overcome the drawback of reduced tactile feedback, real-time tissue classification could be of great benefit. In this ex vivo study, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) was used to distinguish tumor tissue from healthy surrounding tissue. A sample of fat, healthy colorectal wall, and tumor tissue was collected per patient and imaged using two hyperspectral cameras, covering the wavelength range from 400 to 1700 nm. The data were randomly divided into a training (75%) and test (25%) set. After feature reduction, a quadratic classifier and support vector machine were used to distinguish the three tissue types. Tissue samples of 32 patients were imaged using both hyperspectral cameras. The accuracy to distinguish the three tissue types using both hyperspectral cameras was 0.88 (STD  =  0.13) on the test dataset. When the accuracy was determined per patient, a mean accuracy of 0.93 (STD  =  0.12) was obtained on the test dataset. This study shows the potential of using HSI in colorectal cancer surgery for fast tissue classification, which could improve clinical outcome. Future research should be focused on imaging entire colon/rectum specimen and the translation of the technique to an intraoperative setting.

**Authors:** *Goldfarb James W, Craft Jason, Cao J Jane*

**Journal:** *Journal of magnetic resonance imaging : JMRI*

*abstract:* Water-fat separation is a postprocessing technique most commonly applied to multiple-gradient-echo magnetic resonance (MR) images to identify fat, provide images with fat suppression, and to measure fat tissue concentration. Recently, Numerous advancements have been reported. In contrast to early methods, the process of water-fat separation has become complicated due to multiparametric analytic models, optimization methods, and the absence of a unified framework for diverse source data.

**Authors:** *Li Jialiang, Gao Ming, D'Agostino Ralph*

**Journal:** *Statistics in medicine*

*abstract:* Deep learning neural network models such as multilayer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN) are novel and attractive artificial intelligence computing tools. However, evaluation of the performance of these methods is not readily available for practitioners yet. We provide a tutorial for evaluating classification accuracy for various state-of-the-art learning approaches, including familiar shallow and deep learning methods. For qualitative response variables with more than two categories, many traditional accuracy measures such as sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve are not applicable and we have to consider their extensions properly. In this paper, a few important statistical concepts for multicategory classification accuracy are reviewed and their utilities for various learning algorithms are demonstrated with real medical examples. We offer problem-based R code to illustrate how to perform these statistical computations step by step. We expect that such analysis tools will become more familiar to practitioners and receive broader applications in biostatistics.

#### [27. miRLocator: A Python Implementation and Web Server for Predicting miRNAs from Pre-miRNA Sequences.](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-9042-9_6){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Zhang Ting, Ju Lie, Zhai Jingjing, Song Yujia, Song Jie, Ma Chuang*

**Journal:** *Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)*

*abstract:* microRNAs (miRNAs) are short, noncoding regulatory RNAs derived from hairpin precursors (pre-miRNAs). In synergy with experimental approaches, computational approaches have become an invaluable tool for identifying miRNAs at the genome scale. We have recently reported a method called miRLocator, which applies machine learning algorithms to accurately predict the localization of most likely miRNAs within their pre-miRNAs. One major strength of miRLocator is the fact that the machine learning-based miRNA prediction model can be automatically trained using a set of miRNAs of particular interest, with informative features extracted from miRNA-miRNA* duplexes and the optimized ratio between positive and negative samples. Here, we present a detailed protocol for miRLocator that performs the training and prediction processes using a python implementation and web interface. The source codes, web interface, and manual documents are freely available to academic users at https://github.com/cma2015/miRLocator .

#### [28. Building Moral Robots: Ethical Pitfalls and Challenges.](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11948-019-00084-5){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Gordon John-Stewart*

**Journal:** *Science and engineering ethics*

*abstract:* This paper examines the ethical pitfalls and challenges that non-ethicists, such as researchers and programmers in the fields of computer science, artificial intelligence and robotics, face when building moral machines. Whether ethics is "computable" depends on how programmers understand ethics in the first place and on the adequacy of their understanding of the ethical problems and methodological challenges in these fields. Researchers and programmers face at least two types of problems due to their general lack of ethical knowledge or expertise. The first type is so-called rookie mistakes, which could be addressed by providing these people with the necessary ethical knowledge. The second, more difficult methodological issue concerns areas of peer disagreement in ethics, where no easy solutions are currently available. This paper examines several existing approaches to highlight the ethical pitfalls and challenges involved. Familiarity with these and similar problems can help programmers to avoid pitfalls and build better moral machines. The paper concludes that ethical decisions regarding moral robots should be based on avoiding what is immoral (i.e. prohibiting certain immoral actions) in combination with a pluralistic ethical method of solving moral problems, rather than relying on a particular ethical approach, so as to avoid a normative bias.

#### [29. A unifying computational model of decision making.](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10339-019-00904-3){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Kirsch Alexandra*

**Journal:** *Cognitive processing*

*abstract:* Decision making has long been of interest as a descriptive phenomenon in psychology and as a generative one in artificial intelligence. Research ranges from general, descriptive models of heuristic decision making to detailed studies of decision parameters. This paper introduces a model that formalizes and integrates several descriptive models so that it can serve both as a framework for psychological models and as an algorithm for computational decision making. We set special focus on the instantiation of this model with respect to aggregating cue values by reviewing some methods from the field of computational social choice. To show its applicability in the context of artificial intelligence we present a case study of computational problem solving.

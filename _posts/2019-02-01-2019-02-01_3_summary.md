**Journal:** *Journal of the American Chemical Society*

*abstract:* In the past three years, Machine Learning (ML) in combination with Density Functional Theory (DFT) has enabled computational screening of compounds with the goal of accelerated materials discovery. Unfortunately, DFT+ML has, until now, either relied on knowledge of the atomic positions at DFT energy minima, which are a priori unknown, or has been limited to chemical spaces of modest size. Here we report a strategy that we term Learning-in-Templates (LiT) wherein we first define a series of space group and stoichiometry templates corresponding to hypothesized compounds and, orthogonally, we allow any list of atoms to take on any template. The LiT approach is deployed in combination with previously-established position-dependent representations and performs best with the representations that rely least on the atomic positions. Since the positions of the atoms in templates are known and do not change, LiT enables us to infer the properties of interest directly; additionally, LiT allows working with increased chemical spaces, since the same elements can take on a large number of templates. Only by using LiT were we able to span a 5x106 double perovskite compounds and achieve an acceleration factor of 700 compared to brute-force DFT, allowing us to predict never-before-screened compounds. Our findings motivated us to synthesize a new BaCuyTa

**Authors:** *Goldfarb James W, Craft Jason, Cao J Jane*

**Journal:** *Journal of magnetic resonance imaging : JMRI*

*abstract:* Water-fat separation is a postprocessing technique most commonly applied to multiple-gradient-echo magnetic resonance (MR) images to identify fat, provide images with fat suppression, and to measure fat tissue concentration. Recently, Numerous advancements have been reported. In contrast to early methods, the process of water-fat separation has become complicated due to multiparametric analytic models, optimization methods, and the absence of a unified framework for diverse source data.

#### [24. miRLocator: A Python Implementation and Web Server for Predicting miRNAs from Pre-miRNA Sequences.](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-9042-9_6){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Zhang Ting, Ju Lie, Zhai Jingjing, Song Yujia, Song Jie, Ma Chuang*

**Journal:** *Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)*

*abstract:* microRNAs (miRNAs) are short, noncoding regulatory RNAs derived from hairpin precursors (pre-miRNAs). In synergy with experimental approaches, computational approaches have become an invaluable tool for identifying miRNAs at the genome scale. We have recently reported a method called miRLocator, which applies machine learning algorithms to accurately predict the localization of most likely miRNAs within their pre-miRNAs. One major strength of miRLocator is the fact that the machine learning-based miRNA prediction model can be automatically trained using a set of miRNAs of particular interest, with informative features extracted from miRNA-miRNA* duplexes and the optimized ratio between positive and negative samples. Here, we present a detailed protocol for miRLocator that performs the training and prediction processes using a python implementation and web interface. The source codes, web interface, and manual documents are freely available to academic users at https://github.com/cma2015/miRLocator .

#### [25. Building Moral Robots: Ethical Pitfalls and Challenges.](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11948-019-00084-5){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Gordon John-Stewart*

**Journal:** *Science and engineering ethics*

*abstract:* This paper examines the ethical pitfalls and challenges that non-ethicists, such as researchers and programmers in the fields of computer science, artificial intelligence and robotics, face when building moral machines. Whether ethics is "computable" depends on how programmers understand ethics in the first place and on the adequacy of their understanding of the ethical problems and methodological challenges in these fields. Researchers and programmers face at least two types of problems due to their general lack of ethical knowledge or expertise. The first type is so-called rookie mistakes, which could be addressed by providing these people with the necessary ethical knowledge. The second, more difficult methodological issue concerns areas of peer disagreement in ethics, where no easy solutions are currently available. This paper examines several existing approaches to highlight the ethical pitfalls and challenges involved. Familiarity with these and similar problems can help programmers to avoid pitfalls and build better moral machines. The paper concludes that ethical decisions regarding moral robots should be based on avoiding what is immoral (i.e. prohibiting certain immoral actions) in combination with a pluralistic ethical method of solving moral problems, rather than relying on a particular ethical approach, so as to avoid a normative bias.

#### [26. A unifying computational model of decision making.](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10339-019-00904-3){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Kirsch Alexandra*

**Journal:** *Cognitive processing*

*abstract:* Decision making has long been of interest as a descriptive phenomenon in psychology and as a generative one in artificial intelligence. Research ranges from general, descriptive models of heuristic decision making to detailed studies of decision parameters. This paper introduces a model that formalizes and integrates several descriptive models so that it can serve both as a framework for psychological models and as an algorithm for computational decision making. We set special focus on the instantiation of this model with respect to aggregating cue values by reviewing some methods from the field of computational social choice. To show its applicability in the context of artificial intelligence we present a case study of computational problem solving.

#### [28. A scalable discrete-time survival model for neural networks.](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.6257){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Gensheimer Michael F, Narasimhan Balasubramanian*

**Journal:** *PeerJ*

*abstract:* There is currently great interest in applying neural networks to prediction tasks in medicine. It is important for predictive models to be able to use survival data, where each patient has a known follow-up time and event/censoring indicator. This avoids information loss when training the model and enables generation of predicted survival curves. In this paper, we describe a discrete-time survival model that is designed to be used with neural networks, which we refer to as Nnet-survival. The model is trained with the maximum likelihood method using mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The use of SGD enables rapid convergence and application to large datasets that do not fit in memory. The model is flexible, so that the baseline hazard rate and the effect of the input data on hazard probability can vary with follow-up time. It has been implemented in the Keras deep learning framework, and source code for the model and several examples is available online. We demonstrate the performance of the model on both simulated and real data and compare it to existing models Cox-nnet and Deepsurv.

#### [30. Subthalamic nucleus and sensorimotor cortex activity during speech production.](http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=30700532){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Chrabaszcz A, Neumann W J, Stretcu O, Lipski W J, Bush A, Dastolfo-Hromack C, Wang D, Crammond D J, Shaiman S, Dickey M W, Holt L L, Turner R S, Fiez J A, Richardson R M*

**Journal:** *The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience*

*abstract:* The sensorimotor cortex is somatotopically organized to represent the vocal tract articulators, such as lips, tongue, larynx, and jaw. How speech and articulatory features are encoded at the subcortical level, however, remains largely unknown. We analyzed local field potential (LFP) recordings from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and simultaneous electrocorticography recordings from the sensorimotor cortex of 11 human subjects (1 female) with Parkinson's disease during implantation of deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes, while they read aloud three-phoneme words. The initial phonemes involved either articulation primarily with the tongue (coronal consonants) or the lips (labial consonants). We observed significant increases in high gamma (60-150 Hz) power in both the STN and the sensorimotor cortex that began before speech onset and persisted for the duration of speech articulation. As expected from previous reports, in the sensorimotor cortex, the primary articulators involved in the production of the initial consonants were topographically represented by high gamma activity. We found that STN high gamma activity also demonstrated specificity for the primary articulator, although no clear topography was observed. In general, subthalamic high gamma activity varied along the ventral-dorsal trajectory of the electrodes, with greater high gamma power recorded in the dorsal locations of the STN. Interestingly, the majority of significant articulator-discriminative activity in the STN occurred prior to that in sensorimotor cortex. These results demonstrate that articulator-specific speech information is contained within high gamma activity of the STN, but with different spatial and temporal organization compared to similar information encoded in the sensorimotor cortex.

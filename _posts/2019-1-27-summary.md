BACKGROUND: Machine learning (ML) is an application of artificial intelligence
(AI) giving computer systems the ability to learn data, without being explicitly 
programmed. ML is currently successfully used for optical character recognition, 
spam filtering, and face recognition. The aim of this study is to review its
current application in the field of neuro-oncology.
METHODS: We conducted a systematic literature review on PubMed and Cochrane
Database using a keyword search for the period January 30, 2000-March 31, 2018.
Data were clustered for neuro-oncology scope of ML into three categories: patient
outcome predictors, imaging analysis, and gene expression.
RESULTS: Data from 5,346 patients in 29 studies has been used to develop ML based
algorithms (MLBA) in neuro-oncology. MLBA were used to predict outcome in 2,483
patients with a sensitivity range of 78-98% and specificity range of 76-95%. In
all studies, MLBA had higher accuracy than conventional ones. MLBA for image
analysis showed accuracy diagnosing low grade versus high grade gliomas (HGG)
ranging from 80 to 93% and 90% diagnosing HGG versus lymphoma. Seven studies used
MLBA to analyze gene expression in neuro-oncology.
CONCLUSIONS: MLBA in neuro-oncology have shown to predict patients' outcome more 
accurately than conventional parameters in retrospective analysis. If their high 
diagnostic accuracy in imaging analysis and detection of somatic mutations is
corroborated in prospective studies, tissue diagnosis or liquid biopsy might
curtail. Finally, MLBA are promising to help guide targeted therapy, lead to
personalized medicine, and open areas of study in the cancer cellular signaling
system, not otherwise known.

Jenkins J.

OBJECTIVE: To provide expert personal perspectives of genomic health care and
what is needed for nursing to prepare for today as well as for the future.
DATA SOURCES: Personal interviews and published literature.
CONCLUSION: A future that includes genomic information as part of health care is 
exciting, enlightening, and challenging. Nurses must maintain a holistic vision
for implementing genomic health care today and tomorrow.
IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Oncology nurses have opportunities to
integrate genomic information within their practice, education, and research to
improve patient outcomes.

This contribution proposes an implementation for next generation smart homes,
where heterogeneous data, coming from multiple sensors (medical, wellbeing,
energy, contextual, etc.) and house equipment (smart fridge, smart TV, etc.),
need to be managed, secured and visualized. As a first step, it focuses only on
energy and health data. However, it aims to lay the foundations to manage any
type of information towards the development of smart interactions with the house,
which might include artificial intelligence and machine learning. These data are 
securely collected using a central Web of Things gateway, located inside the
smart home. For the e-health part, a set of possible use-cases is provided, along
with the current progress of the implantation. In this regard, the main idea is
to link the next generation smart homes with external medical entities in order
to provide, first, quick intervention in the event of an abnormality being
detected, and to be able to provide basic medical services such as remote
consultations with a doctor for a particular health issue. This vision can be
very promising, particularly in rural areas, where access to medical services is 
difficult. As for the energy part, the aim is to collect users' energy
consumption inside the smart home, which can be supplied from different sources
(heat, water, gas, or electricity), and to enable the use of advanced algorithms 
to predict and manage local energy consumption and production (if any). This
approach combines data collected from smart meters, operational information of
the smart energy devices (the status of smart plugs), user's requests and
external network signals such as energy prices. By using a home energy management
system that accepts such input parameters, the operation of in-home devices and
appliances can be optimally controlled according to different objectives (e.g.,
minimizing energy costs and maximizing user's comfort level).

Purpose: To detect visual field (VF) progression by analyzing spatial pattern
changes.
Methods: We selected 12,217 eyes from 7360 patients with at least five reliable
24-2 VFs and 5 years of follow-up with an interval of at least 6 months. VFs were
decomposed into 16 archetype patterns previously derived by artificial
intelligence techniques. Linear regressions were applied to the 16 archetype
weights of VF series over time. We defined progression as the decrease rate of
the normal archetype or any increase rate of the 15 VF defect archetypes to be
outside normal limits. The archetype method was compared with mean deviation (MD)
slope, Advanced Glaucoma Intervention Study (AGIS) scoring, Collaborative Initial
Glaucoma Treatment Study (CIGTS) scoring, and the permutation of pointwise linear
regression (PoPLR), and was validated by a subset of VFs assessed by three
glaucoma specialists.
Results: In the method development cohort of 11,817 eyes, the archetype method
agreed more with MD slope (kappa: 0.37) and PoPLR (0.33) than AGIS (0.12) and
CIGTS (0.22). The most frequently progressed patterns included decreased normal
pattern (63.7%), and increased nasal steps (16.4%), altitudinal loss (15.9%),
superior-peripheral defect (12.1%), paracentral/central defects (10.5%), and near
total loss (10.4%). In the clinical validation cohort of 397 eyes with 27.5% of
confirmed progression, the agreement (kappa) and accuracy (mean of hit rate and
correct rejection rate) of the archetype method (0.51 and 0.77) significantly (P 
< 0.001 for all) outperformed AGIS (0.06 and 0.52), CIGTS (0.24 and 0.59), MD
slope (0.21 and 0.59), and PoPLR (0.26 and 0.60).
Conclusions: The archetype method can inform clinicians of VF progression
patterns.

With the recent emergence of deep learning1 , artificial intelligence(AI)has
stolen the limelight even in the field of GI endoscopy. It is no exaggeration to 
say that AI is now in its Golden Era. At Digestive Disease Week 2018 held in
Washington DC last June, AI-related presentations have increased from 3 papers
(2017) to 30 (2018).AI is one of the most fascinating topics reported by the
American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. At United European
Gastroenterology Week 2018 held in Vienna in October 2018, there were about 30
AI-related presentations. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

Fossil fuel depletion and the environmental concerns have been under discussion
for energy production for many years and finding new and renewable energy sources
became a must. Biomass is considered as a net zero CO2 energy source.
Gasification of biomass for H2 and syngas production is an attractive process.
The main target of this research is to improve the production of hydrogen and
syngas from palm kernel shell (PKS) steam gasification through defining the
optimal operating parameters' using a modern optimization algorithm. To predict
the gaseous outputs, two PKS models were built using fuzzy logic based on the
experimental data sets. A radial movement optimizer (RMO) was applied to
determine the system's optimal operating parameters. During the optimization
process, the decision variables were represented by four different operating
parameters. These parameters include; temperature, particle size, CaO/biomass
ratio and coal bottom ash (CBA) with their operating ranges of (650-750 °C),
(0.5-1 mm), (0.5-2) and wt% (0.02-0.10), respectively. The individual and
interactive effects of different combinations were investigated on the production
of H2 and syngas yield. The optimized results were compared with experimental
data and results obtained from Response Surface Methodology (RSM) reported in
literature. The obtained optimal values of the operating parameters through RMO
were found 722 °C, 0.92 mm, 1.72 and 0.06 wt% for the temperature, particle size,
CaO/biomass ratio and coal bottom ash, respectively. The results showed that
syngas production was significantly improved as it reached 65.44 vol% which was
better than that obtained in earlier studies.

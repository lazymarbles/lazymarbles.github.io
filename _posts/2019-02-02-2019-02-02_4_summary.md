*abstract:* To precisely diagnose the rotating machinery structural faults, especially structural faults under low rotating speeds, a novel scheme based on combination of empirical mode decomposition (EMD), sample entropy, and deep belief network (DBN) is proposed in this paper. EMD can decompose a signal into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) with different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and sample entropy is performed to extract the signals that carry fault information with high SNR. The extracted fault signal is reconstructed into a new vibration signal that will carry abundant fault information. DBN has strong feature extraction and classification performance. It is suitably performed to build the diagnosis model based on the reconstructed signal. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by structural faults signal and the comparative experiments (BPNN, CNN, time-domain signal only, frequency-domain signal only). The results show that the diagnosis accuracy of the proposed method is between 99% and 100%, the BPNN is less than 25%, and the CNN is between 70% and 95%, which means the verified, proposed method has a superior performance to diagnose the structural fault.

*abstract:* Face recognition is a natural skill that a child performs from the first days of life; unfortunately, there are people with visual or neurological problems that prevent the individual from performing the process visually. This work describes a system that integrates Artificial Intelligence which learns the face of the people with whom the user interacts daily. During the study we propose a new hybrid model of Alpha-Beta Associative memories (Amαβ) with Correlation Matrix (CM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), where the Amαβ-CMKNN was trained with characteristic biometric vectors generated from images of faces from people who present different facial expressions such as happiness, surprise, anger and sadness. To test the performance of the hybrid model, two experiments that differ in the selection of parameters that characterize the face are conducted. The performance of the proposed model was tested in the databases CK+, CAS-PEAL-R1 and Face-MECS (own), which test the Amαβ-CMKNN with faces of subjects of both sexes, different races, facial expressions, poses and environmental conditions. The hybrid model was able to remember 100% of all the faces learned during their training, while in the test in which faces are presented that have variations with respect to those learned the results range from 95.05% in controlled environments and 86.48% in real environments using the proposed integrated system.

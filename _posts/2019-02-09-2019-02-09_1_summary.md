*abstract:* This article, the first in a two-part series, provides an introduction to machine learning in a nuclear medicine context. Part I in this series addresses the history of machine learning and describes common algorithms with illustrations of when these algorithms can be helpful in nuclear medicine. Part II focuses on current contributions of machine learning to our field and addresses future expectations, limitations as well as providing a critical appraisal of what machine learning can and cannot do.

*abstract:* The molecular dipole polarizability describes the tendency of a molecule to change its dipole moment in response to an applied electric field. This quantity governs key intra- and intermolecular interactions, such as induction and dispersion; plays a vital role in determining the spectroscopic signatures of molecules; and is an essential ingredient in polarizable force fields. Compared with other ground-state properties, an accurate prediction of the molecular polarizability is considerably more difficult, as this response quantity is quite sensitive to the underlying electronic structure description. In this work, we present highly accurate quantum mechanical calculations of the static dipole polarizability tensors of 7,211 small organic molecules computed using linear response coupled cluster singles and doubles theory (LR-CCSD). Using a symmetry-adapted machine-learning approach, we demonstrate that it is possible to predict the LR-CCSD molecular polarizabilities of these small molecules with an error that is an order of magnitude smaller than that of hybrid density functional theory (DFT) at a negligible computational cost. The resultant model is robust and transferable, yielding molecular polarizabilities for a diverse set of 52 larger molecules (including challenging conjugated systems, carbohydrates, small drugs, amino acids, nucleobases, and hydrocarbon isomers) at an accuracy that exceeds that of hybrid DFT. The atom-centered decomposition implicit in our machine-learning approach offers some insight into the shortcomings of DFT in the prediction of this fundamental quantity of interest.

*abstract:* We report a machine-learning strategy for design of organic structure directing agents (OSDAs) for zeolite beta. We use machine learning to replace a computationally expensive molecular dynamics evaluation of the stabilization energy of the OSDA inside zeolite beta with a neural network prediction. We train the neural network on 4,781 candidate OSDAs, spanning a range of stabilization energies. We find that the stabilization energies predicted by the neural network are highly correlated with the molecular dynamics computations. We further find that the evolutionary design algorithm samples the space of chemically feasible OSDAs thoroughly. In total, we find 469 OSDAs with verified stabilization energies below -17 kJ/(mol Si), comparable to or better than known OSDAs for zeolite beta, and greatly expanding our previous list of 152 such predicted OSDAs. We expect that these OSDAs will lead to syntheses of zeolite beta.

**Journal:** *Medical engineering & physics*

*abstract:* The goal of this study was to develop and validate a non-invasive approach to estimate scapular kinematics in individual patients. We hypothesized that machine learning algorithms could be developed using motion capture data to accurately estimate dynamic scapula orientation based on measured humeral orientations and acromion process positions. The accuracy of the algorithms was evaluated against a gold standard of biplane fluoroscopy using a 2D to 3D fluoroscopy/model matching process. Individualized neural networks were developed for nine healthy adult shoulders. These models were used to predict scapulothoracic kinematics, and the predicted kinematics were compared to kinematics obtained using biplane fluoroscopy to determine the accuracy of the machine learning algorithms. Results showed correlations between predicted kinematics and validation kinematics. Estimated kinematics were within 10 of validation kinematics. We concluded that individualized machine learning algorithms show promise for providing accurate, non-invasive measurements of scapulothoracic kinematics.

*abstract:* Analytical meditation and monastic debate are contemplative practices engaged in by Tibetan Buddhist monastics that have up to now been largely unexplored in Western contemplative science. The highly physical form of contemplative debating plays an important role in the monastic curriculum. Based on discussions and recorded interviews Tibetan monastic teachers and senior students at Sera Jey Monastic University and preliminary experiments, we outline an initial theory that elucidates the psychological mechanisms underlying this practice. We then make predictions about the potential effects of this form of debating on cognition and emotion. On the basis of initial observations, we propose that successful debating requires skills that include reasoning and critical thinking, attentional focus, working memory, emotion regulation, confidence in your own reasoning skills, and social connectedness. It is therefore likely that the many cumulative hours of debate practice over 20+ years of monastic training helps to cultivate these very skills. Scientific research is needed to examine these hypotheses and determine the role that monastic debate may play in terms of both psychological wellbeing and educational achievement.

**Journal:** *BMC bioinformatics*

*abstract:* Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are emerging as key regulators and play critical roles in a wide range of tumorigenesis. Recent studies have suggested that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) could interact with microRNAs (miRNAs) and indirectly regulate miRNA targets through competing interactions. Therefore, uncovering the competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) regulatory mechanism of lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs in post-transcriptional level will aid in deciphering the underlying pathogenesis of human polygenic diseases and may unveil new diagnostic and therapeutic opportunities. However, the functional roles of vast majority of cancer specific ncRNAs and their combinational regulation patterns are still insufficiently understood.

*abstract:* Early identification of high-risk septic patients in the emergency department (ED) may guide appropriate management and disposition, thereby improving outcomes. We compared the performance of machine learning models against conventional risk stratification tools, namely the Quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA), National Early Warning Score (NEWS), Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS), and our previously described Singapore ED Sepsis (SEDS) model, in the prediction of 30-day in-hospital mortality (IHM) among suspected sepsis patients in the ED.Adult patients who presented to Singapore General Hospital (SGH) ED between September 2014 and April 2016, and who met ≥2 of the 4 Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria were included. Patient demographics, vital signs and heart rate variability (HRV) measures obtained at triage were used as predictors. Baseline models were created using qSOFA, NEWS, MEWS, and SEDS scores. Candidate models were trained using k-nearest neighbors, random forest, adaptive boosting, gradient boosting and support vector machine. Models were evaluated on F1 score and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC).A total of 214 patients were included, of whom 40 (18.7%) met the outcome. Gradient boosting was the best model with a F1 score of 0.50 and AUPRC of 0.35, and performed better than all the baseline comparators (SEDS, F1 0.40, AUPRC 0.22; qSOFA, F1 0.32, AUPRC 0.21; NEWS, F1 0.38, AUPRC 0.28; MEWS, F1 0.30, AUPRC 0.25).A machine learning model can be used to improve prediction of 30-day IHM among suspected sepsis patients in the ED compared to traditional risk stratification tools.

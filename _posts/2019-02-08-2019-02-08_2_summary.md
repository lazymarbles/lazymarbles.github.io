#### [11. Machine learning for prediction of postpartum complications is promising but needs rigorous evaluation.](https://doi.org/10.1111/1471-0528.15645){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Platt Robert W, Grandi Sonia M*

**Journal:** *BJOG : an international journal of obstetrics and gynaecology*

*abstract:* Postpartum complications can be life-threatening, and predicting such complications would be useful to guide follow-up of mothers through the postpartum period. Machine learning is an umbrella term referring to a suite of tools that can provide predictions in a range of settings. Betts et al (Betts BJOG 2019) use machine learning tools and routinely collected administrative data to predict postpartum complications. This article is protected by copyright.

#### [12. A review on lung boundary detection in chest X-rays.](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11548-019-01917-1){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Candemir Sema, Antani Sameer*

**Journal:** *International journal of computer assisted radiology and surgery*

*abstract:* Chest radiography is the most common imaging modality for pulmonary diseases. Due to its wide usage, there is a rich literature addressing automated detection of cardiopulmonary diseases in digital chest X-rays (CXRs). One of the essential steps for automated analysis of CXRs is localizing the relevant region of interest, i.e., isolating lung region from other less relevant parts, for applying decision-making algorithms there. This article provides an overview of the recent literature on lung boundary detection in CXR images.

**Authors:** *Enneking Verena, Dzvonyar Fanni, Dannlowski Udo, Redlich Ronny*

**Journal:** *Der Nervenarzt*

*abstract:* Depression is one of the most frequent and disabling mental disorders worldwide and is accompanied by a severe impairment in the quality of life. There are numerous imaging studies showing differences in the volume of gray and white brain matter and function between patients suffering from depression and healthy controls. Neuroimaging studies show that pharmacotherapy and electroconvulsive therapy are accompanied by an increase of hippocampal gray matter volume while as a result of psychotherapy activity changes in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) have repeatedly been reported. By the identification of neuroanatomical markers, baseline volumes of the ACC have also been shown to be associated with therapy response to all treatments. The identification of such neuronal biomarkers in combination with machine learning techniques provide a promising step towards a neurobiologically based application for the prediction of treatment response.

#### [14. Predictive modeling for response to lithium and quetiapine in bipolar disorder.](https://doi.org/10.1111/bdi.12752){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Kim Thomas T, Dufour Steven, Xu Colin, Cohen Zachary D, Sylvia Louisa, Deckersbach Thilo, DeRubeis Robert J, Nierenberg Andrew A*

**Journal:** *Bipolar disorders*

*abstract:* Lithium and quetiapine are known to be effective treatments for bipolar disorder. However, little information is available to inform prediction of response to these medications. Machine-learning methods can identify predictors of response by examining variables simultaneously. Further evaluation of models on a test sample can estimate how well these models would generalize to other samples.

#### [15. Hospital productivity: The role of efficiency drivers.](https://doi.org/10.1002/hpm.2739){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Ali Manhal, Salehnejad Reza, Mansur Mohaimen*

**Journal:** *The International journal of health planning and management*

*abstract:* A major feature of health-care systems is substantial variation in hospital productivity. Hospital productivity varies widely across countries. The presence of such variation suggests potential areas for improvement, which can substantially lower health-care costs. This research aims to investigate factors that may explain variations in hospital productivity by constructing a longitudinal data (panel) on English NHS hospital trusts. It also seeks to explore possible interactions among the factors in a data-driven manner. We employ unbiased panel regression tree techniques from the machine-learning literature to explore the complex interactive structure of the data. We next use econometric panel regression to deal with individual hospital effects to identify some of the determinants of hospital productivity. The findings point to the significance of efficiency-enhancing mechanisms for hospital productivity, including measures to reduce the length of stay, increase day case (outpatient) surgery rate, and to minimize errors. Further, such measures are shaped by more fundamental factors such as the availability of human capital and management practices. Our results underscore the importance of within-hospital efficiency-enhancing mechanisms to cost-adjusted hospital productivity. Improving hospital operational processes will enhance productivity. At a deeper level, human capital and management practices are likely to be most critical.

**Authors:** *Azimi Saeed, Azhdary Moghaddam Mehdi, Hashemi Monfared Seyed Arman*

**Journal:** *Journal of environmental health science & engineering*

*abstract:* The level of groundwater resources is changing rapidly and this requires the discovery of newer groundwater resources. Drought is one of the most significant natural phenomena affecting different aspects of human life and environment. During the last decades, the application of artificial intelligent techniques has been recognized as effective approaches to forecast an annual precipitation rate.

#### [17. Predicting opioid dependence from electronic health records with machine learning.](https://biodatamining.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13040-019-0193-0){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Ellis Randall J, Wang Zichen, Genes Nicholas, Ma'ayan Avi*

**Journal:** *BioData mining*

*abstract:* The opioid epidemic in the United States is averaging over 100 deaths per day due to overdose. The effectiveness of opioids as pain treatments, and the drug-seeking behavior of opioid addicts, leads physicians in the United States to issue over 200 million opioid prescriptions every year. To better understand the biomedical profile of opioid-dependent patients, we analyzed information from electronic health records (EHR) including lab tests, vital signs, medical procedures, prescriptions, and other data from millions of patients to predict opioid substance dependence.

#### [18. Genomic Selection in Aquaculture: Application, Limitations and Opportunities With Special Reference to Marine Shrimp and Pearl Oysters.](https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2018.00693){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Zenger Kyall R, Khatkar Mehar S, Jones David B, Khalilisamani Nima, Jerry Dean R, Raadsma Herman W*

**Journal:** *Frontiers in genetics*

*abstract:* Within aquaculture industries, selection based on genomic information (genomic selection) has the profound potential to change genetic improvement programs and production systems. Genomic selection exploits the use of realized genomic relationships among individuals and information from genome-wide markers in close linkage disequilibrium with genes of biological and economic importance. We discuss the technical advances, practical requirements, and commercial applications that have made genomic selection feasible in a range of aquaculture industries, with a particular focus on molluscs (pearl oysters,

#### [20. Quantitative Electroencephalography in Guiding Treatment of Major Depression.](https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2018.00779){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Schiller Mark J*

**Journal:** *Frontiers in psychiatry*

*abstract:* This paper reviews significant contributions to the evidence for the use of quantitative electroencephalography features as biomarkers of depression treatment and examines the potential of such technology to guide pharmacotherapy. Frequency band abnormalities such as alpha and theta band abnormalities have shown promise as have combinatorial measures such as cordance (a measure combining alpha and theta power) and the Antidepressant Treatment Response Index in predicting medication treatment response. Nevertheless, studies have been hampered by methodological problems and inconsistencies, and these approaches have ultimately failed to elicit any significant interest in actual clinical practice. More recent machine learning approaches such as the Psychiatric Encephalography Evaluation Registry (PEER) technology and other efforts analyze large datasets to develop variables that may best predict response rather than test a priori hypotheses. PEER is a technology that may go beyond predicting response to a particular antidepressant and help to guide pharmacotherapy.

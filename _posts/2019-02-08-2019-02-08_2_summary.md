**Authors:** *Mishra Avanish, Satsangi Swanti, Rajan Arunkumar Chitteth, Mizuseki Hiroshi, Lee Kwang-Ryeol, Singh Abhishek K*

**Journal:** *The journal of physical chemistry letters*

*abstract:* Functionalized MXene has emerged a promising two-dimensional material having more than tens of thousands of compounds, whose uses may range from electronics to energy applications. Other than the band gap, these properties rely on the accurate position of the band edges. Hence, to synthesize MXenes for various applications, a prior knowledge of the accurate position of their band edges at an absolute scale is essential; computing these with conventional methods would take years for all the MXenes. Here, we develop a machine learning model for positioning the band edges with GW level of accuracy having a minimum root-mean-squared error of 0.12 eV. An intuitive model is proposed based on the combination of Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof band edge and vacuum potential having a correlation of 0.93 with GW band edges. These models can be utilized to identify MXenes for a desired application in an accelerated manner.

**Authors:** *Platt Robert W, Grandi Sonia M*

**Journal:** *BJOG : an international journal of obstetrics and gynaecology*

*abstract:* Postpartum complications can be life-threatening, and predicting such complications would be useful to guide follow-up of mothers through the postpartum period. Machine learning is an umbrella term referring to a suite of tools that can provide predictions in a range of settings. Betts et al (Betts BJOG 2019) use machine learning tools and routinely collected administrative data to predict postpartum complications. This article is protected by copyright.

No LinkOut links available for UID: 30730032

**Authors:** *Candemir Sema, Antani Sameer*

**Journal:** *International journal of computer assisted radiology and surgery*

*abstract:* Chest radiography is the most common imaging modality for pulmonary diseases. Due to its wide usage, there is a rich literature addressing automated detection of cardiopulmonary diseases in digital chest X-rays (CXRs). One of the essential steps for automated analysis of CXRs is localizing the relevant region of interest, i.e., isolating lung region from other less relevant parts, for applying decision-making algorithms there. This article provides an overview of the recent literature on lung boundary detection in CXR images.

*abstract:* Depression is one of the most frequent and disabling mental disorders worldwide and is accompanied by a severe impairment in the quality of life. There are numerous imaging studies showing differences in the volume of gray and white brain matter and function between patients suffering from depression and healthy controls. Neuroimaging studies show that pharmacotherapy and electroconvulsive therapy are accompanied by an increase of hippocampal gray matter volume while as a result of psychotherapy activity changes in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) have repeatedly been reported. By the identification of neuroanatomical markers, baseline volumes of the ACC have also been shown to be associated with therapy response to all treatments. The identification of such neuronal biomarkers in combination with machine learning techniques provide a promising step towards a neurobiologically based application for the prediction of treatment response.

**Authors:** *Kim Thomas T, Dufour Steven, Xu Colin, Cohen Zachary D, Sylvia Louisa, Deckersbach Thilo, DeRubeis Robert J, Nierenberg Andrew A*

**Journal:** *Bipolar disorders*

*abstract:* Lithium and quetiapine are known to be effective treatments for bipolar disorder. However, little information is available to inform prediction of response to these medications. Machine-learning methods can identify predictors of response by examining variables simultaneously. Further evaluation of models on a test sample can estimate how well these models would generalize to other samples.

#### 16. Hospital productivity: The role of efficiency drivers.

**Authors:** *Ali Manhal, Salehnejad Reza, Mansur Mohaimen*

**Journal:** *The International journal of health planning and management*

*abstract:* A major feature of health-care systems is substantial variation in hospital productivity. Hospital productivity varies widely across countries. The presence of such variation suggests potential areas for improvement, which can substantially lower health-care costs. This research aims to investigate factors that may explain variations in hospital productivity by constructing a longitudinal data (panel) on English NHS hospital trusts. It also seeks to explore possible interactions among the factors in a data-driven manner. We employ unbiased panel regression tree techniques from the machine-learning literature to explore the complex interactive structure of the data. We next use econometric panel regression to deal with individual hospital effects to identify some of the determinants of hospital productivity. The findings point to the significance of efficiency-enhancing mechanisms for hospital productivity, including measures to reduce the length of stay, increase day case (outpatient) surgery rate, and to minimize errors. Further, such measures are shaped by more fundamental factors such as the availability of human capital and management practices. Our results underscore the importance of within-hospital efficiency-enhancing mechanisms to cost-adjusted hospital productivity. Improving hospital operational processes will enhance productivity. At a deeper level, human capital and management practices are likely to be most critical.

**Authors:** *Anantpadma Manu, Lane Thomas, Zorn Kimberley M, Lingerfelt Mary A, Clark Alex M, Freundlich Joel S, Davey Robert A, Madrid Peter B, Ekins Sean*

**Journal:** *ACS omega*

*abstract:* We have previously described the first Bayesian machine learning models from FDA-approved drug screens, for identifying compounds active against the Ebola virus (EBOV). These models led to the identification of three active molecules in vitro: tilorone, pyronaridine, and quinacrine. A follow-up study demonstrated that one of these compounds, tilorone, has 100% in vivo efficacy in mice infected with mouse-adapted EBOV at 30 mg/kg/day intraperitoneal. This suggested that we can learn from the published data on EBOV inhibition and use it to select new compounds for testing that are active in vivo. We used these previously built Bayesian machine learning EBOV models alongside our chemical insights for the selection of 12 molecules, absent from the training set, to test for in vitro EBOV inhibition. Nine molecules were directly selected using the model, and eight of these molecules possessed a promising in vitro activity (EC

**Authors:** *Azimi Saeed, Azhdary Moghaddam Mehdi, Hashemi Monfared Seyed Arman*

**Journal:** *Journal of environmental health science & engineering*

*abstract:* The level of groundwater resources is changing rapidly and this requires the discovery of newer groundwater resources. Drought is one of the most significant natural phenomena affecting different aspects of human life and environment. During the last decades, the application of artificial intelligent techniques has been recognized as effective approaches to forecast an annual precipitation rate.

**Authors:** *Rivenson Yair, Liu Tairan, Wei Zhensong, Zhang Yibo, de Haan Kevin, Ozcan Aydogan*

**Journal:** *Light, science & applications*

*abstract:* Using a deep neural network, we demonstrate a digital staining technique, which we term PhaseStain, to transform the quantitative phase images (QPI) of label-free tissue sections into images that are equivalent to the brightfield microscopy images of the same samples that are histologically stained. Through pairs of image data (QPI and the corresponding brightfield images, acquired after staining), we train a generative adversarial network and demonstrate the effectiveness of this virtual-staining approach using sections of human skin, kidney, and liver tissue, matching the brightfield microscopy images of the same samples stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin, Jones' stain, and Masson's trichrome stain, respectively. This digital-staining framework may further strengthen various uses of label-free QPI techniques in pathology applications and biomedical research in general, by eliminating the need for histological staining, reducing sample preparation related costs and saving time. Our results provide a powerful example of some of the unique opportunities created by data-driven image transformations enabled by deep learning.

#### [21. Selecting precise reference normal tissue samples for cancer research using a deep learning approach.](https://bmcmedgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12920-018-0463-6){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Zeng William Z D, Glicksberg Benjamin S, Li Yangyan, Chen Bin*

**Journal:** *BMC medical genomics*

*abstract:* Normal tissue samples are often employed as a control for understanding disease mechanisms, however, collecting matched normal tissues from patients is difficult in many instances. In cancer research, for example, the open cancer resources such as TCGA and TARGET do not provide matched tissue samples for every cancer or cancer subtype. The recent GTEx project has profiled samples from healthy individuals, providing an excellent resource for this field, yet the feasibility of using GTEx samples as the reference remains unanswered.

#### [22. Predicting drug response of tumors from integrated genomic profiles by deep neural networks.](https://bmcmedgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12920-018-0460-9){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Chiu Yu-Chiao, Chen Hung-I Harry, Zhang Tinghe, Zhang Songyao, Gorthi Aparna, Wang Li-Ju, Huang Yufei, Chen Yidong*

**Journal:** *BMC medical genomics*

*abstract:* The study of high-throughput genomic profiles from a pharmacogenomics viewpoint has provided unprecedented insights into the oncogenic features modulating drug response. A recent study screened for the response of a thousand human cancer cell lines to a wide collection of anti-cancer drugs and illuminated the link between cellular genotypes and vulnerability. However, due to essential differences between cell lines and tumors, to date the translation into predicting drug response in tumors remains challenging. Recently, advances in deep learning have revolutionized bioinformatics and introduced new techniques to the integration of genomic data. Its application on pharmacogenomics may fill the gap between genomics and drug response and improve the prediction of drug response in tumors.

**Authors:** *Wang Xuewei, Sun Zhifu, Zimmermann Michael T, Bugrim Andrej, Kocher Jean-Pierre*

**Journal:** *BMC medical genomics*

*abstract:* Predicting cellular responses to drugs has been a major challenge for personalized drug therapy regimen. Recent pharmacogenomic studies measured the sensitivities of heterogeneous cell lines to numerous drugs, and provided valuable data resources to develop and validate computational approaches for the prediction of drug responses. Most of current approaches predict drug sensitivity by building prediction models with individual genes, which suffer from low reproducibility due to biologic variability and difficulty to interpret biological relevance of novel gene-drug associations. As an alternative, pathway activity scores derived from gene expression could predict drug response of cancer cells.

*abstract:* Artificial intelligence clinical decision-support system is an important direction of artificial intelligence in the medical field. Both international and domestic researchers are exploring the application value of intelligent decision-making system in the field of cancer. But at the same time of the craze, there are still some problems in the intelligent decision-making system. Combining the work of the research groups in this field, this paper explores the current confusions and solutions, and hopes to help clinicians better understand intelligent decision-making. It is believed that with the deepening of the concept and the advancement of technology, intelligent decision-making will become a good help for doctors in the future.

#### [26. A Precise Diagnosis Method of Structural Faults of Rotating Machinery based on Combination of Empirical Mode Decomposition, Sample Entropy, and Deep Belief Network.](http://www.mdpi.com/resolver?pii=s19030591){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Guan Zhaoyi, Liao Zhiqiang, Li Ke, Chen Peng*

**Journal:** *Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)*

*abstract:* To precisely diagnose the rotating machinery structural faults, especially structural faults under low rotating speeds, a novel scheme based on combination of empirical mode decomposition (EMD), sample entropy, and deep belief network (DBN) is proposed in this paper. EMD can decompose a signal into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) with different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and sample entropy is performed to extract the signals that carry fault information with high SNR. The extracted fault signal is reconstructed into a new vibration signal that will carry abundant fault information. DBN has strong feature extraction and classification performance. It is suitably performed to build the diagnosis model based on the reconstructed signal. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by structural faults signal and the comparative experiments (BPNN, CNN, time-domain signal only, frequency-domain signal only). The results show that the diagnosis accuracy of the proposed method is between 99% and 100%, the BPNN is less than 25%, and the CNN is between 70% and 95%, which means the verified, proposed method has a superior performance to diagnose the structural fault.

#### [27. System for Face Recognition under Different Facial Expressions Using a New Associative Hybrid Model Amαβ-KNN for People with Visual Impairment or Prosopagnosia.](http://www.mdpi.com/resolver?pii=s19030578){: .btn}

**Journal:** *Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)*

*abstract:* Face recognition is a natural skill that a child performs from the first days of life; unfortunately, there are people with visual or neurological problems that prevent the individual from performing the process visually. This work describes a system that integrates Artificial Intelligence which learns the face of the people with whom the user interacts daily. During the study we propose a new hybrid model of Alpha-Beta Associative memories (Amαβ) with Correlation Matrix (CM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), where the Amαβ-CMKNN was trained with characteristic biometric vectors generated from images of faces from people who present different facial expressions such as happiness, surprise, anger and sadness. To test the performance of the hybrid model, two experiments that differ in the selection of parameters that characterize the face are conducted. The performance of the proposed model was tested in the databases CK+, CAS-PEAL-R1 and Face-MECS (own), which test the Amαβ-CMKNN with faces of subjects of both sexes, different races, facial expressions, poses and environmental conditions. The hybrid model was able to remember 100% of all the faces learned during their training, while in the test in which faces are presented that have variations with respect to those learned the results range from 95.05% in controlled environments and 86.48% in real environments using the proposed integrated system.

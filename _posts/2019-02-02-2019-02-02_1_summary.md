*abstract:* Utilization of existing clinical data for improving patient outcomes poses a number of challenging and complex problems involving lack of data integration, the absence of standardization across inhomogeneous data sources and computationally-demanding and time-consuming exploration of very large datasets. In this paper, we will present a robust semantic data integration, standardization and dimensionality reduction method to tackle and solve these problems. Our approach enables the integration of clinical data from diverse sources by resolving canonical inconsistencies and semantic heterogeneity as required by the National Library of Medicine's Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) to produce standardized medical data. Through a combined application of rule-based semantic networks and machine learning, our approach enables a large reduction in dimensionality of the data and thus allows for fast and efficient application of data mining techniques to large clinical datasets. An example application of the techniques developed in our study is presented for the prediction of bariatric surgery outcomes.

*abstract:* Landslides are major hazards for human activities often causing great damage to human lives and infrastructure. Therefore, the main aim of the present study is to evaluate and compare three machine learning algorithms (MLAs) including Naïve Bayes (NB), radial basis function (RBF) Classifier, and RBF Network for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) at Longhai area in China. A total of 14 landslide conditioning factors were obtained from various data sources, then the frequency ratio (FR) and support vector machine (SVM) methods were used for the correlation and selection the most important factors for modelling process, respectively. Subsequently, the resulting three models were validated and compared using some statistical metrics including area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) curve, and Friedman and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests The results indicated that the RBF Classifier model had the highest goodness-of-fit and performance based on the training and validation datasets. The results concluded that the RBF Classifier model outperformed and outclassed (AUROC = 0.881), the NB (AUROC = 0.872) and the RBF Network (AUROC = 0.854) models. The obtained results pointed out that the RBF Classifier model is a promising method for spatial prediction of landslide over the world.

*abstract:* Many patients with cirrhosis who undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) screening for esophageal varices (EVs) are found to have no or only small EVs. Endoscopic screening for EVs is therefore a potentially deferrable procedure that increases patient risk and healthcare cost. We developed and validated a scoring system, based on readily-available data, to identify patients with EVs varices that need treatment.

## 4. Effort-aware and just-in-time defect prediction with neural network.

*abstract:* Effort-aware just-in-time (JIT) defect prediction is to rank source code changes based on the likelihood of detects as well as the effort to inspect such changes. Accurate defect prediction algorithms help to find more defects with limited effort. To improve the accuracy of defect prediction, in this paper, we propose a deep learning based approach for effort-aware just-in-time defect prediction. The key idea of the proposed approach is that neural network and deep learning could be exploited to select useful features for defect prediction because they have been proved excellent at selecting useful features for classification and regression. First, we preprocess ten numerical metrics of code changes, and then feed them to a neural network whose output indicates how likely the code change under test contains bugs. Second, we compute the benefit cost ratio for each code change by dividing the likelihood by its size. Finally, we rank code changes according to their benefit cost ratio. Evaluation results on a well-known data set suggest that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on each of the subject projects. It improves the average recall and popt by 15.6% and 8.1%, respectively.

*abstract:* Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most important causes of blindness worldwide, especially in developed countries. In diabetic patients, periodic examination of the back of the eye using a nonmydriatic camera has been widely demonstrated to be an effective system to control and prevent the onset of DR. Convolutional neural networks have been used to detect DR, achieving very high sensitivities and specificities.

*Journal: Current computer-aided drug design* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-30*



*abstract:* Tuberculosis, malaria, dengue, chikungunya, leishmaniasis etc. are a large group of neglected tropical diseases that prevail in tropical and subtropical countries, affecting one billion people every year. Minimal funding and grants for research on these scientific problems challenge many researcher to find a different way to reduce the extensive time and cost involved in the drug discovery cycle of these problems. Computer-aided drug design techniques have already been proved successful in discovery of new molecules rationally by reducing the time and cost involved in the development of drugs. In the current minireview, we are highlighting on the molecular modeling studies published during 2010-2018 for target specific antitubercular agents. This review includes the studies of structure-based (SB) and ligand-based (LB) studies and those involving machine learning (ML) techniques against different antitubercular targets such as dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), enoyl acyl carrier protein (ACP) reductase (InhA), catalase-peroxidase (KatG), enzyme antigen 85C, protein tyrosine phosphatases (PtpA and PtpB), dUTPase, thioredoxin reductase (MtTrxR), etc. The information presented in this review will help the researchers to get acquainted with the recent progress in the modeling studies of antitubercular agents.

## 1. Avoiding hERG-liability in drug design via synergetic combinations of different (Q)SAR methodologies and data sources: a case study in an industrial setting.
**Keywords:** **'Combining models', 'Expert system', 'Machine learning', 'Public–private data sharing', 'QSAR', 'SOHN', 'Temporal study', 'hERG'**

*Journal: Journal of cheminformatics* *Publication Date: 2019-Feb-02*



*abstract:* In this paper, we explore the impact of combining different in silico prediction approaches and data sources on the predictive performance of the resulting system. We use inhibition of the hERG ion channel target as the endpoint for this study as it constitutes a key safety concern in drug development and a potential cause of attrition. We will show that combining data sources can improve the relevance of the training set in regard of the target chemical space, leading to improved performance. Similarly we will demonstrate that combining multiple statistical models together, and with expert systems, can lead to positive synergistic effects when taking into account the confidence in the predictions of the merged systems. The best combinations analyzed display a good hERG predictivity. Finally, this work demonstrates the suitability of the SOHN methodology for building models in the context of receptor based endpoints like hERG inhibition when using the appropriate pharmacophoric descriptors.

## 2. Using machine learning to optimize selection of elderly patients for endovascular thrombectomy.
**Keywords:** **'stroke', 'thrombectomy'**

*Journal: Journal of neurointerventional surgery* *Publication Date: 2019-Feb-02*



*abstract:* Endovascular thrombectomy (ET) is the standard of care for treatment of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) secondary to large vessel occlusion. The elderly population has been under-represented in clinical trials on ET, and recent studies have reported higher morbidity and mortality in elderly patients than in their younger counterparts.

## 3. Automated segmentation of haematoma and perihaematomal oedema in MRI of acute spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage.
**Keywords:** **'Brain MRI', 'Image segmentation', 'Spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage', 'Stroke'**

*Journal: Computers in biology and medicine* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-29*



*abstract:* Spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage (SICH) is a common condition with high morbidity and mortality. Segmentation of haematoma and perihaematoma oedema on medical images provides quantitative outcome measures for clinical trials and may provide important markers of prognosis in people with SICH.

## 4. Seizure detection by convolutional neural network-based analysis of scalp electroencephalography plot images.
**Keywords:** **'Convolutional neural networks', 'Deep learning', 'Epileptic seizure', 'Scalp electroencephalogram', 'Seizure detection'**

*Journal: NeuroImage. Clinical* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-22*



*abstract:* We hypothesized that expert epileptologists can detect seizures directly by visually analyzing EEG plot images, unlike automated methods that analyze spectro-temporal features or complex, non-stationary features of EEG signals. If so, seizure detection could benefit from convolutional neural networks because their visual recognition ability is comparable to that of humans. We explored image-based seizure detection by applying convolutional neural networks to long-term EEG that included epileptic seizures. After filtering, EEG data were divided into short segments based on a given time window and converted into plot EEG images, each of which was classified by convolutional neural networks as 'seizure' or 'non-seizure'. These resultant labels were then used to design a clinically practical index for seizure detection. The best true positive rate was obtained using a 1-s time window. The median true positive rate of convolutional neural networks labelling by seconds was 74%, which was higher than that of commercially available seizure detection software (20% by BESA and 31% by Persyst). For practical use, the median of detected seizure rate by minutes was 100% by convolutional neural networks, which was higher than the 73.3% by BESA and 81.7% by Persyst. The false alarm of convolutional neural networks' seizure detection was issued at 0.2 per hour, which appears acceptable for clinical practice. Moreover, we demonstrated that seizure detection improved when training was performed using EEG patterns similar to those of testing data, suggesting that adding a variety of seizure patterns to the training dataset will improve our method. Thus, artificial visual recognition by convolutional neural networks allows for seizure detection, which otherwise currently relies on skillful visual inspection by expert epileptologists during clinical diagnosis.

## 5. Exposure measurement error in air pollution studies: A framework for assessing shared, multiplicative measurement error in ensemble learning estimates of nitrogen oxides.


*Journal: Environment international* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-31*



*abstract:* Increasingly ensemble learning-based spatiotemporal models are being used to estimate residential air pollution exposures in epidemiological studies. While these machine learning models typically have improved performance, they suffer from exposure measurement error that is inherent in all models. Our objective is to develop a framework to formally assess shared, multiplicative measurement error (SMME) in our previously published three-stage, ensemble learning-based nitrogen oxides (NO

## 7. Physicochemical property based computational scheme for classifying DNA sequence elements of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
**Keywords:** **'Computational scheme', 'DNA sequence elements', 'DTPM', 'Machine learning', 'Physicochemical properties'**

*Journal: Computational biology and chemistry* *Publication Date: 2018-Dec-26*



*abstract:* GenerationE of huge "omics" data necessitates the development and application of computational methods to annotate the data in terms of biological features. In the context of DNA sequence, it is important to unravel the hidden physicochemical signatures. For this purpose, we have considered various sequence elements such as promoter, ACS, LTRs, telomere, and retrotransposon of the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Contributions due to di-nucleotides play a major role in studying the DNA conformation profile. The physicochemical parameters used are hydrogen bonding energy, stacking energy and solvation energy per base pair. Our computational study shows that all sequence elements in this study have distinctive physicochemical signatures and the same can be exploited for prediction experiments. The order that we see in a DNA sequence is dictated by biological regions and hence, there exists role of dependency in the sequence makeup, keeping this in mind we are proposing two computational schemes (a) using a windowing block size procedure and (b) using di-nucleotide transitions. We obtained better discriminating profile when we analyzed the sequence data in windowing manner. In the second novel approach, we introduced the di-nucleotide transition probability matrix (DTPM) to study the hidden layer of information embedded in the sequences. DTPM has been used as weights for scanning and predictions. This proposed computational scheme incorporates the memory property which is more realistic to study the physicochemical properties embedded in DNA sequences. Our analysis shows that the DTPM scheme performs better than the existing method in this applied region. Characterization of these elements will be a key to genome editing applications and advanced machine learning approaches may also require such distinctive profiles as useful input features.

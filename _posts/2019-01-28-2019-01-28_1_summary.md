#### [1. tRNA-DL: A Deep Learning Approach to Improve tRNAscan-SE Prediction Results.](https://www.karger.com?DOI=10.1159/000493215){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Gao Xin, Wei Zhi, Hakonarson Hakon*

*abstract:* tRNAscan-SE is the leading tool for transfer RNA (tRNA) annotation, which has been widely used in the field. However, tRNAscan-SE can return a significant number of false positives when applied to large sequences. Recently, conventional machine learning methods have been proposed to address this issue, but their efficiency can be still limited due to their dependency on handcrafted features. With the growing availability of large-scale genomic data-sets, deep learning methods, especially convolutional neural networks, have demonstrated excellent power in characterizing sequence patterns in genomic sequences. Thus, we hypothesize that deep learning may bring further improvement for tRNA prediction.

#### [2. Exploiting electrostatic shielding-effect of metal nanoparticles to recognize uncharged small molecule affinity with label-free graphene electronic biosensor.](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0956-5663(19)30019-3){: .btn}

**Journal:** *Biosensors & bioelectronics*

*abstract:* Label-free electronic biosensors as the non-electrochemical analytical tools without requirement of sophisticated instrumentation have become attractive, although their application in competitive affinity sensing of uncharged small molecules is still ﻿hindered by a difficulty in the development of competing analogues. To break through this bottleneck, we report a novel analogue made by epitope-modified metal nanoparticles to enable the electronic signaling of small-molecule analyte recognition via competitive affinity. While the electronic signaling capability of metal nanoparticle analogues is demonstrated by a graphene field-effect transistor bioassay of small-molecule glucose as a proof-of-principle, interestingly, we discover a new electronic signaling mechanism in the metal nanoparticle affinity, different to the intuitive charge accumulation expectation. On the basis of Kelvin-probe force microscopic potential characterization and theoretical discussion, we fundamentally elucidated the signaling mechanism as a seldom used electrostatic shielding-effect, that is, in the analogue-receptor affinity, metal nanoparticles with the charge density lower than receptor biomolecules can reduce the collective electrical potential via charge dispersion. Further consider the convenient epitope-modifiability of metal nanoparticles, the easy-to-develop analogues for diverse target analyte might potentially be predictable in the future. And the application of label-free electronic biosensors for the competitive affinity bioassay of range-extended small molecules may thus be promoted based on the electrostatic shielding-effect.

#### [3. Pros and cons of virtual screening based on public "Big Data": In silico mining for new bromodomain inhibitors.](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0223-5234(19)30016-9){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Casciuc Iuri, Horvath Dragos, Gryniukova Anastasiia, Tolmachova Kateryna A, Vasylchenko Oleksandr V, Borysko Petro, Moroz Yurii S, Bajorath Jürgen, Varnek Alexandre*

**Journal:** *European journal of medicinal chemistry*

*abstract:* The Virtual Screening (VS) study described herein aimed at detecting novel Bromodomain BRD4 binders and relied on knowledge from public databases (ChEMBL, REAXYS) to establish a battery of predictive models of BRD activity for in silico selection of putative ligands. Beyond the actual discovery of new BRD ligands, this represented an opportunity to practically estimate the actual usefulness of public domain "Big Data" for robust predictive model building. Obtained models were used to virtually screen a collection of 2 million compounds from the Enamine company collection. This industrial partner then experimentally screened a subset of 2992 molecules selected by the VS procedure for their high likelihood to be active. Twenty nine confirmed hits were detected after experimental testing, representing 1% of the selected candidates. As a general conclusion, this study emphasizes once more that public structure-activity databases are nowadays key assets in drug discovery. Their usefulness is however limited by the state-of-the-art knowledge harvested so far by published studies. Target-specific structure-activity information is rarely rich enough, and its heterogeneity makes it extremely difficult to exploit in rational drug design. Furthermore, published affinity measures serving to build models selecting compounds to be experimentally screened may not be well correlated with the experimental hit selection criterion (in practice, often imposed by equipment constraints). Nevertheless, a robust 2.6-fold increase in hit rate with respect to an equivalent, random screening campaign showed that machine learning is able to extract some real knowledge in spite of all the noise in structure-activity data.

#### [4. A volatilomics approach for off-line discrimination of minced beef and pork meat and their admixture using HS-SPME GC/MS in tandem with multivariate data analysis.](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0309-1740(18)30974-4){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Pavlidis Dimitrios E, Mallouchos Athanasios, Ercolini Danilo, Panagou Efstathios Z, Nychas George-John E*

**Journal:** *Meat science*

*abstract:* Beef, pork and mixed (70% beef and 30% pork) minced meat samples were obtained from a meat processing plant in Athens during a two-year survey and analyzed both microbiologically and by headspace solid-phase microextraction in combination with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (HS-SPME/GC-MS). A validated method for the discrimination of minced meat was developed based on the volatile fingerprints. Unsupervised (PCA) and supervised (PLS-DA) multivariate statistical methods were applied to visualize, group and classify the samples. The data-set was divided 70% for model calibration and 30% for model prediction. During model calibration 99, 100 and 100% of the samples were correctly classified as beef, pork and mixed meat samples, respectively, while for model prediction the respective percentages were 100, 100 and 95% respectively. In both datasets, the overall correct classification rate amounted to 99% on average. Among the volatile compounds identified, heptanal, octanal, butanol, pentanol, hexanol, octanol, 1-penten-3-ol, 2-octen-1-ol, 3-hydroxy-2-butanone, 2-butanone and 2-heptanone were positively correlated with beef samples. Furthermore, pentanal, hexanal, decanal, nonanal, benzaldehyde, trans-2-hexenal, trans-2-heptenal, trans-2-octenal and 1-octen-3-one were positively correlated with pork. Lastly, the alcohols, 2-butanol and 1-octen-3-ol showed positive correlation with mixed samples. The results indicated that the volatilomics approach employed in this study could be used as an alternative method for robust and reliable discrimination and classification of meat samples in an off-line mode.

#### [6. Predictors of in-hospital length of stay among cardiac patients: A machine learning approach.](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167-5273(18)34602-3){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Daghistani Tahani A, Elshawi Radwa, Sakr Sherif, Ahmed Amjad M, Al-Thwayee Abdullah, Al-Mallah Mouaz H*

**Journal:** *International journal of cardiology*

*abstract:* The In-hospital length of stay (LOS) is expected to increase as cardiovascular diseases complexity increases and the population ages. This will affect healthcare systems especially with the current situation of decreased bed capacity and increasing costs. Therefore, accurately predicting LOS would have a positive impact on healthcare metrics. The aim of this study is to develop a machine learning-based model approach for predicting in-hospital LOS for cardiac patients.

#### [7. Non-invasive prediction of blood glucose trends during hypoglycemia.](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003-2670(18)31444-2){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Tronstad Christian, Elvebakk Ole, Staal Odd Martin, Kalvøy Håvard, Høgetveit Jan Olav, Jenssen Trond Geir, Birkeland Kåre Inge, Martinsen Ørjan G*

**Journal:** *Analytica chimica acta*

*abstract:* Over the last four decades, there has been a pursuit for a non-invasive solution for glucose measurement, but there is not yet any viable product released. Of the many sensor modalities tried, the combination of electrical and optical measurement is among the most promising for continuous measurements. Although non-invasive prediction of exact glucose levels may seem futile, prediction of their trends may be useful for certain applications. Hypoglycemia is the most serious of the acute complications in type-1 diabetes highlighting the need for a reliable alarm, but little is known about the performance of this technology in predicting hypoglycemic glucose levels and associated trends. We aimed to assess such performance on the way to develop a multisensor system for detection of hypoglycemia, based on near-infrared (NIR), bioimpedance and skin temperature measurements taken during hypoglycemic and euglycemic glucose clamps in 20 subjects with type-1 diabetes. Performance of blood glucose prediction was assessed by global partial least squares and neural network regression models using repeated double cross-validation. Best trend prediction was obtained by including all measurements in a neural network model. Prediction of glucose level was inaccurate for threshold-based detection of hypoglycemia, but the trend predictions may provide useful information in a multisensor system. Comparing NIR and bioimpedance measurements, NIR seems to be the main predictor of blood glucose while bioimpedance may act as correction for individual confounding properties.

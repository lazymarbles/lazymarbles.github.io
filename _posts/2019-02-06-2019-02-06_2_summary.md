## 31. Agency plus automation: Designing artificial intelligence into interactive systems.
**Authors:** *Heer Jeffrey*

**Journal:** *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America*

*abstract:* Much contemporary rhetoric regards the prospects and pitfalls of using artificial intelligence techniques to automate an increasing range of tasks, especially those once considered the purview of people alone. These accounts are often wildly optimistic, understating outstanding challenges while turning a blind eye to the human labor that undergirds and sustains ostensibly "automated" services. This long-standing focus on purely automated methods unnecessarily cedes a promising design space: one in which computational assistance augments and enriches, rather than replaces, people's intellectual work. This tension between human agency and machine automation poses vital challenges for design and engineering. In this work, we consider the design of systems that enable rich, adaptive interaction between people and algorithms. We seek to balance the often-complementary strengths and weaknesses of each, while promoting human control and skillful action. We share case studies of interactive systems we have developed in three arenas-data wrangling, exploratory analysis, and natural language translation-that integrate proactive computational support into interactive systems. To improve outcomes and support learning by both people and machines, we describe the use of shared representations of tasks augmented with predictive models of human capabilities and actions. We conclude with a discussion of future prospects and scientific frontiers for intelligence augmentation research.

## 32. Single-cell profiling of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma reveals underlying heterogeneity associated with disease progression.
**Authors:** *Borcherding Nicholas, Voigt Andrew P, Liu Vincent, Link Brian K, Zhang Weizhou, Jabbari Ali*

**Journal:** *Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research*

*abstract:* Cutaneous T cell lymphomas (CTCL), encompassing a spectrum of T-cell lymphoproliferative disorders involving the skin, have collectively increased in incidence over the last 40 years. Sézary syndrome (SS) is an aggressive form of CTCL characterized by significant presence of malignant cells in both the blood and skin. The guarded prognosis for SS reflects a lack of reliably effective therapy, due in part to an incomplete understanding of disease pathogenesis.

## 33. A novel prediction method for lymph node involvement in endometrial cancer: machine learning.
**Authors:** *Günakan Emre, Atan Suat, Haberal Asuman Nihan, Küçükyıldız İrem Alyazıcı, Gökçe Ehad, Ayhan Ali*

**Journal:** *International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society*

*abstract:* The necessity of lymphadenectomy and the prediction of lymph node involvement (LNI) in endometrial cancer (EC) have been hotly-debated questions in recent years. Machine learning is a broad field that can produce results and estimations. In this study we constructed prediction models for EC patients using the Naïve Bayes machine learning algorithm for LNI prediction.

## 36. Somatic and sociodemographic predictors of depression outcome among depressed patients with coronary artery disease - a secondary analysis of the SPIRR-CAD study.
**Authors:** *Vitinius Frank, Escherich Steffen, Deter Hans-Christian, Hellmich Martin, Jünger Jana, Petrowski Katja, Ladwig Karl-Heinz, Lambertus Frank, Michal Matthias, Weber Cora, de Zwaan Martina, Herrmann-Lingen Christoph, Ronel Joram, Albus Christian*

**Journal:** *BMC psychiatry*

*abstract:* Depressive symptoms are common in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and are associated with an unfavourable outcome. Establishing prognostic patient profiles prior to the beginning of mental health care may facilitate higher efficacy of targeted interventions. The aim of the current study was to identify sociodemographic and somatic predictors of depression outcome among depressed patients with CAD.

## 37. Inverse similarity and reliable negative samples for drug side-effect prediction.
**Authors:** *Zheng Yi, Peng Hui, Ghosh Shameek, Lan Chaowang, Li Jinyan*

**Journal:** *BMC bioinformatics*

*abstract:* In silico prediction of potential drug side-effects is of crucial importance for drug development, since wet experimental identification of drug side-effects is expensive and time-consuming. Existing computational methods mainly focus on leveraging validated drug side-effect relations for the prediction. The performance is severely impeded by the lack of reliable negative training data. Thus, a method to select reliable negative samples becomes vital in the performance improvement.

## 38. BioReader: a text mining tool for performing classification of biomedical literature.
**Authors:** *Simon Christian, Davidsen Kristian, Hansen Christina, Seymour Emily, Barnkob Mike Bogetofte, Olsen Lars Rønn*

**Journal:** *BMC bioinformatics*

*abstract:* Scientific data and research results are being published at an unprecedented rate. Many database curators and researchers utilize data and information from the primary literature to populate databases, form hypotheses, or as the basis for analyses or validation of results. These efforts largely rely on manual literature surveys for collection of these data, and while querying the vast amounts of literature using keywords is enabled by repositories such as PubMed, filtering relevant articles from such query results can be a non-trivial and highly time consuming task.

## 40. Mining-Guided Machine Learning Analyses Revealed the Latest Trends in Neuro-Oncology.
**Authors:** *Hana Taijun, Tanaka Shota, Nejo Takahide, Takahashi Satoshi, Kitagawa Yosuke, Koike Tsukasa, Nomura Masashi, Takayanagi Shunsaku, Saito Nobuhito*

**Journal:** *Cancers*

*abstract:* In conducting medical research, a system which can objectively predict the future trends of the given research field is awaited. This study aims to establish a novel and versatile algorithm that predicts the latest trends in neuro-oncology. Seventy-nine neuro-oncological research fields were selected with computational sorting methods such as text-mining analyses. Thirty journals that represent the recent trends in neuro-oncology were also selected. As a novel concept, the annual impact (AI) of each year was calculated for each journal and field (number of articles published in the journal × impact factor of the journal). The AI index (AII) for the year was defined as the sum of the AIs of the 30 journals. The AII trends of the 79 fields from 2008 to 2017 were subjected to machine learning predicting analyses. The accuracy of the predictions was validated using actual past data. With this algorithm, the latest trends in neuro-oncology were predicted. As a result, the linear prediction model achieved relatively good accuracy. The predicted hottest fields in recent neuro-oncology included some interesting emerging fields such as microenvironment and anti-mitosis. This algorithm may be an effective and versatile tool for prediction of future trends in a particular medical field.

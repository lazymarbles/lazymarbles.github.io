**Authors:** *Zheng Yi, Peng Hui, Ghosh Shameek, Lan Chaowang, Li Jinyan*

**Journal:** *BMC bioinformatics*

*abstract:* In silico prediction of potential drug side-effects is of crucial importance for drug development, since wet experimental identification of drug side-effects is expensive and time-consuming. Existing computational methods mainly focus on leveraging validated drug side-effect relations for the prediction. The performance is severely impeded by the lack of reliable negative training data. Thus, a method to select reliable negative samples becomes vital in the performance improvement.

**Authors:** *Simon Christian, Davidsen Kristian, Hansen Christina, Seymour Emily, Barnkob Mike Bogetofte, Olsen Lars Rønn*

**Journal:** *BMC bioinformatics*

*abstract:* Scientific data and research results are being published at an unprecedented rate. Many database curators and researchers utilize data and information from the primary literature to populate databases, form hypotheses, or as the basis for analyses or validation of results. These efforts largely rely on manual literature surveys for collection of these data, and while querying the vast amounts of literature using keywords is enabled by repositories such as PubMed, filtering relevant articles from such query results can be a non-trivial and highly time consuming task.

**Authors:** *Hana Taijun, Tanaka Shota, Nejo Takahide, Takahashi Satoshi, Kitagawa Yosuke, Koike Tsukasa, Nomura Masashi, Takayanagi Shunsaku, Saito Nobuhito*

**Journal:** *Cancers*

*abstract:* In conducting medical research, a system which can objectively predict the future trends of the given research field is awaited. This study aims to establish a novel and versatile algorithm that predicts the latest trends in neuro-oncology. Seventy-nine neuro-oncological research fields were selected with computational sorting methods such as text-mining analyses. Thirty journals that represent the recent trends in neuro-oncology were also selected. As a novel concept, the annual impact (AI) of each year was calculated for each journal and field (number of articles published in the journal × impact factor of the journal). The AI index (AII) for the year was defined as the sum of the AIs of the 30 journals. The AII trends of the 79 fields from 2008 to 2017 were subjected to machine learning predicting analyses. The accuracy of the predictions was validated using actual past data. With this algorithm, the latest trends in neuro-oncology were predicted. As a result, the linear prediction model achieved relatively good accuracy. The predicted hottest fields in recent neuro-oncology included some interesting emerging fields such as microenvironment and anti-mitosis. This algorithm may be an effective and versatile tool for prediction of future trends in a particular medical field.

**Authors:** *Duan Gui-Jiang, Yan Xin, Ma Hong*

**Journal:** *Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)*

*abstract:* In driver training, the correct observation of the trainees' operation is the key to ensure the training quality. The operation of the vehicle can be expressed by the vehicle state changes. This paper proposes a driver training model based on a multiple-embedded-sensor net. Six vehicle state parameters are identified as the critical features of the reverse parking machine learning model and represented quantitatively. A multiple-embedded-sensor net-based system mounted on a real vehicle is developed to collect the actual data of the six critical features. The data collected at the same time are bound together and encapsulated into a vector and sequenced by time with a label given by the multiple-embedded-sensor net. All vectors are evaluated by subjective assessment conclusions from experienced driving instructors and the positive ones are used as the training data of the model. The trained model can remind the driver of the next correct operation during training, and can also analyze the improvements after the training. The model has achieved good results in practical application. The experiments prove the validity and reliability of the proposed driver training model.

**Journal:** *Journal of clinical medicine*

*abstract:* This review paper presents a framework to evaluate the artificial intelligence (AI) readiness for the healthcare sector in developing countries: a combination of adequate technical or technological expertise, financial sustainability, and socio-political commitment embedded in a healthy psycho-cultural context could bring about the smooth transitioning toward an AI-powered healthcare sector. Taking the Vietnamese healthcare sector as a case study, this paper attempts to clarify the negative and positive influencers. With only about 1500 publications about AI from 1998 to 2017 according to the latest Elsevier AI report, Vietnamese physicians are still capable of applying the state-of-the-art AI techniques in their research. However, a deeper look at the funding sources suggests a lack of socio-political commitment, hence the financial sustainability, to advance the field. The AI readiness in Vietnam's healthcare also suffers from the unprepared information infrastructure-using text mining for the official annual reports from 2012 to 2016 of the Ministry of Health

**Authors:** *Zhou Baoding, Yang Jun, Li Qingquan*

**Journal:** *Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)*

*abstract:* In the indoor environment, the activity of the pedestrian can reflect some semantic information. These activities can be used as the landmarks for indoor localization. In this paper, we propose a pedestrian activities recognition method based on a convolutional neural network. A new convolutional neural network has been designed to learn the proper features automatically. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves approximately 98% accuracy in about 2 s in identifying nine types of activities, including still, walk, upstairs, up elevator, up escalator, down elevator, down escalator, downstairs and turning. Moreover, we have built a pedestrian activity database, which contains more than 6 GB of data of accelerometers, magnetometers, gyroscopes and barometers collected with various types of smartphones. We will make it public to contribute to academic research.

#### [40. Outage Performance Analysis and SWIPT Optimization in Energy-Harvesting Wireless Sensor Network Deploying NOMA.](http://www.mdpi.com/resolver?pii=s19030613){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Nguyen Hoang-Sy, Ly Tran Thai Hoc, Nguyen Thanh-Sang, Huynh Van Van, Nguyen Thanh-Long, Voznak Miroslav*

**Journal:** *Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)*

*abstract:* Thanks to the benefits of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in wireless communications, we evaluate a wireless sensor network deploying NOMA (WSN-NOMA), where the destination can receive two data symbols in a whole transmission process with two time slots. In this work, two relaying protocols, so-called time-switching-based relaying WSN-NOMA (TSR WSN-NOMA) and power-splitting-based relaying WSN-NOMA (PSR WSN-NOMA) are deployed to study energy-harvesting (EH). Regarding the system performance analysis, we obtain the closed-form expressions for the exact and approximate outage probability (OP) in both protocols, and the delay-limited throughput is also evaluated. We then compare the two protocols theoretically, and two optimization problems are formulated to reduce the impact of OP and optimize the data rate. Our numerical and simulation results are provided to prove the theoretical and analytical analysis. Thanks to these results, a great performance gain can be achieved for both TSR WSN-NOMA and PSR WSN-NOMA if optimal values of TS and PS ratios are found. In addition, the optimized TSR WSN-NOMA outperforms that of PSR WSN-NOMA in terms of OP.

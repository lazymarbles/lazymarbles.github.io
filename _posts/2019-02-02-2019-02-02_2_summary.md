**Keywords:** **'Neglected diseases', 'antitubercular targets', 'ligand-based', 'machine learning ', 'structure-based'**

*Journal: Current computer-aided drug design* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-30*



*abstract:* Tuberculosis, malaria, dengue, chikungunya, leishmaniasis etc. are a large group of neglected tropical diseases that prevail in tropical and subtropical countries, affecting one billion people every year. Minimal funding and grants for research on these scientific problems challenge many researcher to find a different way to reduce the extensive time and cost involved in the drug discovery cycle of these problems. Computer-aided drug design techniques have already been proved successful in discovery of new molecules rationally by reducing the time and cost involved in the development of drugs. In the current minireview, we are highlighting on the molecular modeling studies published during 2010-2018 for target specific antitubercular agents. This review includes the studies of structure-based (SB) and ligand-based (LB) studies and those involving machine learning (ML) techniques against different antitubercular targets such as dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), enoyl acyl carrier protein (ACP) reductase (InhA), catalase-peroxidase (KatG), enzyme antigen 85C, protein tyrosine phosphatases (PtpA and PtpB), dUTPase, thioredoxin reductase (MtTrxR), etc. The information presented in this review will help the researchers to get acquainted with the recent progress in the modeling studies of antitubercular agents.

*abstract:* One of the key challenges with big data is leveraging the complex network of information to yield useful clinical insights. The confluence of massive amounts of health data and a desire to make inferences and insights on these data has produced a substantial amount of interest in machine-learning analytic methods. There has been a drastic increase in the otolaryngology literature volume describing novel applications of machine learning within the past 5â€‰years. In this timely contemporary review, we provide an overview of popular machine-learning techniques, and review recent machine-learning applications in otolaryngology-head and neck surgery including neurotology, head and neck oncology, laryngology, and rhinology. Investigators have realized significant success in validated models with model sensitivities and specificities approaching 100%. Challenges remain in the implementation of machine-learning algorithms. This may be in part the unfamiliarity of these techniques to clinician leaders on the front lines of patient care. Spreading awareness and confidence in machine learning will follow with further validation and proof-of-value analyses that demonstrate model performance superiority over established methods. We are poised to see a greater influx of machine-learning applications to clinical problems in otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, and it is prudent for providers to understand the potential benefits and limitations of these technologies.

## 12. Recent technical development of artificial intelligence for diagnostic medical imaging.
**Keywords:** **'Artificial intelligence', 'Computer vision', 'Deep learning'**

*Journal: Japanese journal of radiology* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-31*

[https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11604-018-0804-6](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11604-018-0804-6){: .btn}

*abstract:* Deep learning has caused a third boom of artificial intelligence and great changes of diagnostic medical imaging systems such as radiology, pathology, retinal imaging, dermatology inspection, and endoscopic diagnosis will be expected in the near future. However, various attempts and new methods of deep learning have been proposed in recent years, and their progress is extremely fast. Therefore, at the initial stage when medical artificial intelligence papers were published, the artificial intelligence technology itself may be old technology or well-known general-purpose common technology. Therefore, the author has reviewed state-of-the-art computer vision papers and presentations of 2018 using deep learning technologies, which will have future clinical potentials selected from the point of view of a radiologist such as generative adversarial network, knowledge distillation, and general image data sets for supervised learning.

## 13. Meta-analysis of the moral brain: patterns of neural engagement assessed using multilevel kernel density analysis.
**Keywords:** **'MKDA', 'Machine learning', 'Meta-analysis', 'Moral', 'fMRI'**

*Journal: Brain imaging and behavior* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-31*

[https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11682-019-00035-5](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11682-019-00035-5){: .btn}

*abstract:* The neuroimaging literature in moral cognition has rapidly developed in the last decade with more than 200 publications on the topic. Neuroimaging based models generally agree that limbic regions work with medial prefrontal and temporal regions during moral processing to integrate emotional, social, and cognitive elements into decision-making. However, no quantitative work has been done examining neural response across types of moral cognition tasks. This paper uses Multilevel Kernel Density Analysis (MKDA) to conduct neuroimaging meta-analyses of the moral cognitive literature. MKDA replicated previous findings of the neural correlates of moral cognition: the left amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex, bilateral temporoparietal junction, and posterior cingulate. Random forest algorithms classified neural features as belonging to simple/utilitarian moral dilemmas, explicit/implicit moral tasks, and word/picture moral stimuli tasks; in combination with univariate contrast analyses, these results indicated a distinct pattern of processing for each of the members of these paradigm pairs. Overall, the results emphasize that the task selected for use in a moral cognition neuroimaging study is vital for the elicitation and interpretation of results. It also replicates and re-establishes the neural basis for moral processing, especially important in light of implementation errors in previous meta-analysis.

## 14. Predicting Breast Cancer Molecular Subtype with MRI Dataset Utilizing Convolutional Neural Network Algorithm.
**Keywords:** **'Breast MRI', 'CNN', 'Molecular subtype'**

*Journal: Journal of digital imaging* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-31*

[https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10278-019-00179-2](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10278-019-00179-2){: .btn}

*abstract:* To develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm that can predict the molecular subtype of a breast cancer based on MRI features. An IRB-approved study was performed in 216 patients with available pre-treatment MRIs and immunohistochemical staining pathology data. First post-contrast MRI images were used for 3D segmentation using 3D slicer. A CNN architecture was designed with 14 layers. Residual connections were used in the earlier layers to allow stabilization of gradients during backpropagation. Inception style layers were utilized deeper in the network to allow learned segregation of more complex feature mappings. Extensive regularization was utilized including dropout, L2, feature map dropout, and transition layers. The class imbalance was addressed by doubling the input of underrepresented classes and utilizing a class sensitive cost function. Parameters were tuned based on a 20% validation group. A class balanced holdout set of 40 patients was utilized as the testing set. Software code was written in Python using the TensorFlow module on a Linux workstation with one NVidia Titan X GPU. Seventy-four luminal A, 106 luminal B, 13 HER2+, and 23 basal breast tumors were evaluated. Testing set accuracy was measured at 70%. The class normalized macro area under receiver operating curve (ROC) was measured at 0.853. Non-normalized micro-aggregated AUC was measured at 0.871, representing improved discriminatory power for the highly represented Luminal A and Luminal B subtypes. Aggregate sensitivity and specificity was measured at 0.603 and 0.958. MRI analysis of breast cancers utilizing a novel CNN can predict the molecular subtype of breast cancers. Larger data sets will likely improve our model.

**Keywords:** **'Twitter', 'big data analytics', 'deep learning', 'disease detection', 'streaming'**

*Journal: Proceedings : ... IEEE International Conference on Big Data. IEEE International Conference on Big Data* *Publication Date: 2018-Dec*



*abstract:* We present the Twitter Health Surveillance (THS) application framework. THS is designed as an integrated platform to help health officials collect tweets, determine if they are related with a medical condition, extract metadata out of them, and create a big data warehouse that can be used to further analyze the data. THS is built atop open source tools and provides the following value added services: Data Acquisition, Tweet Classification, and Big Data Warehousing. In order to validate THS, we have created a collection of roughly twelve thousands labelled tweets. These tweets contain one or more target medical terms, and the labels indicate if the tweet is related or not to a medical condition. We used this collection to test various models based on LSTM and GRU recurrent neural networks. Our experiments show that we can classify tweets with 96% precision, 92% recall, and 91% F1 score. These results compare favorably with recent research on this area, and show the promise of our THS system.

## 17. Machine Learning in Health Care: A Critical Appraisal of Challenges and Opportunities.
**Keywords:** **'data science', 'information technology', 'learning health', 'machine learning', 'translational research'**

*Journal: EGEMS (Washington, DC)* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-24*



*abstract:* Examples of fully integrated machine learning models that drive clinical care are rare. Despite major advances in the development of methodologies that outperform clinical experts and growing prominence of machine learning in mainstream medical literature, major challenges remain. At Duke Health, we are in our fourth year developing, piloting, and implementing machine learning technologies in clinical care. To advance the translation of machine learning into clinical care, health system leaders must address barriers to progress and make strategic investments necessary to bring health care into a new digital age. Machine learning can improve clinical workflows in subtle ways that are distinct from how statistics has shaped medicine. However, most machine learning research occurs in siloes, and there are important, unresolved questions about how to retrain and validate models post-deployment. Academic medical centers that cultivate and value transdisciplinary collaboration are ideally suited to integrate machine learning in clinical care. Along with fostering collaborative environments, health system leaders must invest in developing new capabilities within the workforce and technology infrastructure beyond standard electronic health records. Now is the opportunity to break down barriers and achieve scalable growth in the number of high-impact collaborations between clinical researchers and machine learning experts to transform clinical care.

## 18. Automated Classification of Pulmonary Nodules through a Retrospective Analysis of Conventional CT and Two-phase PET Images in Patients Undergoing Biopsy.
**Keywords:** **'Classification', 'Computer-aided diagnosis', 'Lung cancer', 'PET/CT', 'Pulmonary nodule'**

*Journal: Asia Oceania journal of nuclear medicine & biology* *Publication Date: 2019*



*abstract:* Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) examination is commonly used for the evaluation of pulmonary nodules since it provides both anatomical and functional information. However, given the dependence of this evaluation on physician's subjective judgment, the results could be variable. The purpose of this study was to develop an automated scheme for the classification of pulmonary nodules using early and delayed phase PET/CT and conventional CT images.

## 19. Integrated Cognitive Assessment: Speed and Accuracy of Visual Processing as a Reliable Proxy to Cognitive Performance.


*Journal: Scientific reports* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-31*

[http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-37709-x](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-37709-x){: .btn}

*abstract:* Various mental disorders are accompanied by some degree of cognitive impairment. Particularly in neurodegenerative disorders, cognitive impairment is the phenotypical hallmark of the disease. Effective, accurate and timely cognitive assessment is key to early diagnosis of this family of mental disorders. Current standard-of-care techniques for cognitive assessment are primarily paper-based, and need to be administered by a healthcare professional; they are additionally language and education-dependent and typically suffer from a learning bias. These tests are thus not ideal for large-scale pro-active cognitive screening and disease progression monitoring. We developed the Integrated Cognitive Assessment (referred to as CGN_ICA), a 5-minute computerized cognitive assessment tool based on a rapid visual categorization task, in which a series of carefully selected natural images of varied difficulty are presented to participants. Overall 448 participants, across a wide age-range with different levels of education took the CGN_ICA test. We compared participants' CGN_ICA test results with a variety of standard pen-and-paper tests, such as Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), that are routinely used to assess cognitive performance. CGN_ICA had excellent test-retest reliability, showed convergent validity with the standard-of-care cognitive tests used here, and demonstrated to be suitable for micro-monitoring of cognitive performance.

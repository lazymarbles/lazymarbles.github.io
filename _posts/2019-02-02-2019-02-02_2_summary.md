#### [11. Meta-analysis of the moral brain: patterns of neural engagement assessed using multilevel kernel density analysis.](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11682-019-00035-5){: .btn}

*abstract:* The neuroimaging literature in moral cognition has rapidly developed in the last decade with more than 200 publications on the topic. Neuroimaging based models generally agree that limbic regions work with medial prefrontal and temporal regions during moral processing to integrate emotional, social, and cognitive elements into decision-making. However, no quantitative work has been done examining neural response across types of moral cognition tasks. This paper uses Multilevel Kernel Density Analysis (MKDA) to conduct neuroimaging meta-analyses of the moral cognitive literature. MKDA replicated previous findings of the neural correlates of moral cognition: the left amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex, bilateral temporoparietal junction, and posterior cingulate. Random forest algorithms classified neural features as belonging to simple/utilitarian moral dilemmas, explicit/implicit moral tasks, and word/picture moral stimuli tasks; in combination with univariate contrast analyses, these results indicated a distinct pattern of processing for each of the members of these paradigm pairs. Overall, the results emphasize that the task selected for use in a moral cognition neuroimaging study is vital for the elicitation and interpretation of results. It also replicates and re-establishes the neural basis for moral processing, especially important in light of implementation errors in previous meta-analysis.

#### [12. Predicting Breast Cancer Molecular Subtype with MRI Dataset Utilizing Convolutional Neural Network Algorithm.](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10278-019-00179-2){: .btn}

**Journal:** *Journal of digital imaging*

*abstract:* To develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm that can predict the molecular subtype of a breast cancer based on MRI features. An IRB-approved study was performed in 216 patients with available pre-treatment MRIs and immunohistochemical staining pathology data. First post-contrast MRI images were used for 3D segmentation using 3D slicer. A CNN architecture was designed with 14 layers. Residual connections were used in the earlier layers to allow stabilization of gradients during backpropagation. Inception style layers were utilized deeper in the network to allow learned segregation of more complex feature mappings. Extensive regularization was utilized including dropout, L2, feature map dropout, and transition layers. The class imbalance was addressed by doubling the input of underrepresented classes and utilizing a class sensitive cost function. Parameters were tuned based on a 20% validation group. A class balanced holdout set of 40 patients was utilized as the testing set. Software code was written in Python using the TensorFlow module on a Linux workstation with one NVidia Titan X GPU. Seventy-four luminal A, 106 luminal B, 13 HER2+, and 23 basal breast tumors were evaluated. Testing set accuracy was measured at 70%. The class normalized macro area under receiver operating curve (ROC) was measured at 0.853. Non-normalized micro-aggregated AUC was measured at 0.871, representing improved discriminatory power for the highly represented Luminal A and Luminal B subtypes. Aggregate sensitivity and specificity was measured at 0.603 and 0.958. MRI analysis of breast cancers utilizing a novel CNN can predict the molecular subtype of breast cancers. Larger data sets will likely improve our model.

*abstract:* Various mental disorders are accompanied by some degree of cognitive impairment. Particularly in neurodegenerative disorders, cognitive impairment is the phenotypical hallmark of the disease. Effective, accurate and timely cognitive assessment is key to early diagnosis of this family of mental disorders. Current standard-of-care techniques for cognitive assessment are primarily paper-based, and need to be administered by a healthcare professional; they are additionally language and education-dependent and typically suffer from a learning bias. These tests are thus not ideal for large-scale pro-active cognitive screening and disease progression monitoring. We developed the Integrated Cognitive Assessment (referred to as CGN_ICA), a 5-minute computerized cognitive assessment tool based on a rapid visual categorization task, in which a series of carefully selected natural images of varied difficulty are presented to participants. Overall 448 participants, across a wide age-range with different levels of education took the CGN_ICA test. We compared participants' CGN_ICA test results with a variety of standard pen-and-paper tests, such as Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), that are routinely used to assess cognitive performance. CGN_ICA had excellent test-retest reliability, showed convergent validity with the standard-of-care cognitive tests used here, and demonstrated to be suitable for micro-monitoring of cognitive performance.

#### [15. High resolution mapping of a cold water coral mound.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-37725-x){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Conti Luis A, Lim Aaron, Wheeler Andrew J*

**Journal:** *Scientific reports*

*abstract:* Cold-water coral (CWC) mounds are biogenic, long-lived morphostructures composed primarily by scleractinian CWC's and hemipelagic sediments that form complex deep-sea microhabitats found globally but specifically along the European-Atlantic margin. In this work, high-resolution mapping was applied to identify individual organismal distribution and zonation across a CWC Piddington Mound within the Porcupine Seabight, Ireland Margin. Marine Object-Based Image Analysis (MOBIA) and different machine learning classification methods (decision tree, logistic regression, and deep neural network) were applied to a high-resolution (2 mm) reef-scale video mosaic and ROV-mounted multibeam data in order to provide new insights into the spatial organization of coral frameworks and environmental factors on CWC mounds. The results showed an accurate quantification of the amount of Coral Framework (14.5%; ~2% live and ~12.5% dead) and sponges (~3.5%) with heterogeneous distribution, restricted to a certain portion of the mound. This is the first object level quantification of live and dead coral framework facies and individual sponges across an entire CWC mound. This approach has application for habitat and conservation studies, provides a quantification tool for carbon budget assessments and can provide a baseline to assess CWC mound change. The approach can also be modified for application in other habitats.

#### [16. A feasibility study for predicting optimal radiation therapy dose distributions of prostate cancer patients from patient anatomy using deep learning.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-37741-x){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Nguyen Dan, Long Troy, Jia Xun, Lu Weiguo, Gu Xuejun, Iqbal Zohaib, Jiang Steve*

**Journal:** *Scientific reports*

*abstract:* With the advancement of treatment modalities in radiation therapy for cancer patients, outcomes have improved, but at the cost of increased treatment plan complexity and planning time. The accurate prediction of dose distributions would alleviate this issue by guiding clinical plan optimization to save time and maintain high quality plans. We have modified a convolutional deep network model, U-net (originally designed for segmentation purposes), for predicting dose from patient image contours of the planning target volume (PTV) and organs at risk (OAR). We show that, as an example, we are able to accurately predict the dose of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for prostate cancer patients, where the average Dice similarity coefficient is 0.91 when comparing the predicted vs. true isodose volumes between 0% and 100% of the prescription dose. The average value of the absolute differences in [max, mean] dose is found to be under 5% of the prescription dose, specifically for each structure is [1.80%, 1.03%](PTV), [1.94%, 4.22%](Bladder), [1.80%, 0.48%](Body), [3.87%, 1.79%](L Femoral Head), [5.07%, 2.55%](R Femoral Head), and [1.26%, 1.62%](Rectum) of the prescription dose. We thus managed to map a desired radiation dose distribution from a patient's PTV and OAR contours. As an additional advantage, relatively little data was used in the techniques and models described in this paper.

#### [17. Discovering highly selective and diverse PPAR-delta agonists by ligand based machine learning and structural modeling.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-38508-8){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Da'adoosh Benny, Marcus David, Rayan Anwar, King Fred, Che Jianwei, Goldblum Amiram*

**Journal:** *Scientific reports*

*abstract:* PPAR-δ agonists are known to enhance fatty acid metabolism, preserving glucose and physical endurance and are suggested as candidates for treating metabolic diseases. None have reached the clinic yet. Our Machine Learning algorithm called "Iterative Stochastic Elimination" (ISE) was applied to construct a ligand-based multi-filter ranking model to distinguish between confirmed PPAR-δ agonists and random molecules. Virtual screening of 1.56 million molecules by this model picked ~2500 top ranking molecules. Subsequent docking to PPAR-δ structures was mainly evaluated by geometric analysis of the docking poses rather than by energy criteria, leading to a set of 306 molecules that were sent for testing in vitro. Out of those, 13 molecules were found as potential PPAR-δ agonist leads with EC

#### [18. Multi-Channel 3D Deep Feature Learning for Survival Time Prediction of Brain Tumor Patients Using Multi-Modal Neuroimages.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-37387-9){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Nie Dong, Lu Junfeng, Zhang Han, Adeli Ehsan, Wang Jun, Yu Zhengda, Liu LuYan, Wang Qian, Wu Jinsong, Shen Dinggang*

**Journal:** *Scientific reports*

*abstract:* High-grade gliomas are the most aggressive malignant brain tumors. Accurate pre-operative prognosis for this cohort can lead to better treatment planning. Conventional survival prediction based on clinical information is subjective and could be inaccurate. Recent radiomics studies have shown better prognosis by using carefully-engineered image features from magnetic resonance images (MRI). However, feature engineering is usually time consuming, laborious and subjective. Most importantly, the engineered features cannot effectively encode other predictive but implicit information provided by multi-modal neuroimages. We propose a two-stage learning-based method to predict the overall survival (OS) time of high-grade gliomas patient. At the first stage, we adopt deep learning, a recently dominant technique of artificial intelligence, to automatically extract implicit and high-level features from multi-modal, multi-channel preoperative MRI such that the features are competent of predicting survival time. Specifically, we utilize not only contrast-enhanced T1 MRI, but also diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), for computing multiple metric maps (including various diffusivity metric maps derived from DTI, and also the frequency-specific brain fluctuation amplitude maps and local functional connectivity anisotropy-related metric maps derived from rs-fMRI) from 68 high-grade glioma patients with different survival time. We propose a multi-channel architecture of 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for deep learning upon those metric maps, from which high-level predictive features are extracted for each individual patch of these maps. At the second stage, those deeply learned features along with the pivotal limited demographic and tumor-related features (such as age, tumor size and histological type) are fed into a support vector machine (SVM) to generate the final prediction result (i.e., long or short overall survival time). The experimental results demonstrate that this multi-model, multi-channel deep survival prediction framework achieves an accuracy of 90.66%, outperforming all the competing methods. This study indicates highly demanded effectiveness on prognosis of deep learning technique in neuro-oncological applications for better individualized treatment planning towards precision medicine.

#### [19. Theories of Error Back-Propagation in the Brain.](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1364-6613(19)30012-9){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Whittington James C R, Bogacz Rafal*

**Journal:** *Trends in cognitive sciences*

*abstract:* This review article summarises recently proposed theories on how neural circuits in the brain could approximate the error back-propagation algorithm used by artificial neural networks. Computational models implementing these theories achieve learning as efficient as artificial neural networks, but they use simple synaptic plasticity rules based on activity of presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. The models have similarities, such as including both feedforward and feedback connections, allowing information about error to propagate throughout the network. Furthermore, they incorporate experimental evidence on neural connectivity, responses, and plasticity. These models provide insights on how brain networks might be organised such that modification of synaptic weights on multiple levels of cortical hierarchy leads to improved performance on tasks.

**Authors:** *Kallianos K, Mongan J, Antani S, Henry T, Taylor A, Abuya J, Kohli M*

**Journal:** *Clinical radiology*

*abstract:* Due to recent advances in artificial intelligence, there is renewed interest in automating interpretation of imaging tests. Chest radiographs are particularly interesting due to many factors: relatively inexpensive equipment, importance to public health, commonly performed throughout the world, and deceptively complex taking years to master. This article presents a brief introduction to artificial intelligence, reviews the progress to date in chest radiograph interpretation, and provides a snapshot of the available datasets and algorithms available to chest radiograph researchers. Finally, the limitations of artificial intelligence with respect to interpretation of imaging studies are discussed.

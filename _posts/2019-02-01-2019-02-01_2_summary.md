#### [31. A scalable discrete-time survival model for neural networks.](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.6257){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Gensheimer Michael F, Narasimhan Balasubramanian*

**Journal:** *PeerJ*

*abstract:* There is currently great interest in applying neural networks to prediction tasks in medicine. It is important for predictive models to be able to use survival data, where each patient has a known follow-up time and event/censoring indicator. This avoids information loss when training the model and enables generation of predicted survival curves. In this paper, we describe a discrete-time survival model that is designed to be used with neural networks, which we refer to as Nnet-survival. The model is trained with the maximum likelihood method using mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The use of SGD enables rapid convergence and application to large datasets that do not fit in memory. The model is flexible, so that the baseline hazard rate and the effect of the input data on hazard probability can vary with follow-up time. It has been implemented in the Keras deep learning framework, and source code for the model and several examples is available online. We demonstrate the performance of the model on both simulated and real data and compare it to existing models Cox-nnet and Deepsurv.

*abstract:* Pain is an unpleasant experience the neurobiology of which is influenced by psychosocial factors including negative affect. Music is a ubiquitous experience that can improve affect, potentially decreasing anxiety and catastrophizing, both of which are associated with greater pain severity. We hypothesized that a machine-learning generative music intervention in the form of a smartphone web app (Unwind) could be used to modulate the experience of pain. In this pilot study, we recruited 15 individuals with acute pain who were admitted to an observation unit in the emergency department, and were being treated with opioids. Participants used the music intervention (Unwind) during this brief hospitalization, after which we assessed their response to its use through a semi-structured qualitative interview. Overall, participants responded positively to Unwind. While some reported some technical challenges, participants were willing to continue using it at home. In particular, participants reported using Unwind to address their anxiety, and many used it to facilitate sleep in the presence of pain. This study demonstrates that individuals with acute pain will accept and use a smartphone-based music protocol.

#### [34. Subthalamic nucleus and sensorimotor cortex activity during speech production.](http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=30700532){: .btn}

*abstract:* The sensorimotor cortex is somatotopically organized to represent the vocal tract articulators, such as lips, tongue, larynx, and jaw. How speech and articulatory features are encoded at the subcortical level, however, remains largely unknown. We analyzed local field potential (LFP) recordings from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and simultaneous electrocorticography recordings from the sensorimotor cortex of 11 human subjects (1 female) with Parkinson's disease during implantation of deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes, while they read aloud three-phoneme words. The initial phonemes involved either articulation primarily with the tongue (coronal consonants) or the lips (labial consonants). We observed significant increases in high gamma (60-150 Hz) power in both the STN and the sensorimotor cortex that began before speech onset and persisted for the duration of speech articulation. As expected from previous reports, in the sensorimotor cortex, the primary articulators involved in the production of the initial consonants were topographically represented by high gamma activity. We found that STN high gamma activity also demonstrated specificity for the primary articulator, although no clear topography was observed. In general, subthalamic high gamma activity varied along the ventral-dorsal trajectory of the electrodes, with greater high gamma power recorded in the dorsal locations of the STN. Interestingly, the majority of significant articulator-discriminative activity in the STN occurred prior to that in sensorimotor cortex. These results demonstrate that articulator-specific speech information is contained within high gamma activity of the STN, but with different spatial and temporal organization compared to similar information encoded in the sensorimotor cortex.

#### [36. Temporal indexing of medical entity in Chinese clinical notes.](https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12911-019-0735-x){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Liu Zengjian, Wang Xiaolong, Chen Qingcai, Tang Buzhou, Xu Hua*

**Journal:** *BMC medical informatics and decision making*

*abstract:* The goal of temporal indexing is to select an occurred time or time interval for each medical entity in clinical notes, so that all medical entities can be indexed on a united timeline, which could assist the understanding of clinical notes and the further application of medical entities. Some temporal relation shared tasks for the medical entity in English clinical notes have been organized in the past few years, such as the 2012 i2b2 NLP challenge, 2015 and 2016 clinical TempEval challenges. In these tasks, many heuristics rule-based and machine learning-based systems have been developed. In recent years, the deep neural network models have shown great potential on many problems including the relation classification.

#### [37. Integrating shortest dependency path and sentence sequence into a deep learning framework for relation extraction in clinical text.](https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12911-019-0736-9){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Li Zhiheng, Yang Zhihao, Shen Chen, Xu Jun, Zhang Yaoyun, Xu Hua*

**Journal:** *BMC medical informatics and decision making*

*abstract:* Extracting relations between important clinical entities is critical but very challenging for natural language processing (NLP) in the medical domain. Researchers have applied deep learning-based approaches to clinical relation extraction; but most of them consider sentence sequence only, without modeling syntactic structures. The aim of this study was to utilize a deep neural network to capture the syntactic features and further improve the performances of relation extraction in clinical notes.

#### [40. A Hybrid Clustering Algorithm for Identifying Cell Types from Single-Cell RNA-Seq Data.](http://www.mdpi.com/resolver?pii=genes10020098){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Zhu Xiaoshu, Li Hong-Dong, Xu Yunpei, Guo Lilu, Wu Fang-Xiang, Duan Guihua, Wang Jianxin*

*abstract:* Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has recently brought new insight into cell differentiation processes and functional variation in cell subtypes from homogeneous cell populations. A lack of prior knowledge makes unsupervised machine learning methods, such as clustering, suitable for analyzing scRNA-seq . However, there are several limitations to overcome, including high dimensionality, clustering result instability, and parameter adjustment complexity. In this study, we propose a method by combining structure entropy and k nearest neighbor to identify cell subpopulations in scRNA-seq data. In contrast to existing clustering methods for identifying cell subtypes, minimized structure entropy results in natural communities without specifying the number of clusters. To investigate the performance of our model, we applied it to eight scRNA-seq datasets and compared our method with three existing methods (nonnegative matrix factorization, single-cell interpretation via multikernel learning, and structural entropy minimization principle). The experimental results showed that our approach achieves, on average, better performance in these datasets compared to the benchmark methods.

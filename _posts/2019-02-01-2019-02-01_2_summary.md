*Journal: IEEE transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-25*

*abstract:* Data-driven spatial filtering algorithms optimize scores such as the contrast between two conditions to extract oscillatory brain signal components. Most machine learning approaches for filter estimation, however, disregard within-trial temporal dynamics and are extremely sensitive to changes in training data and involved hyperparameters. This leads to highly variable solutions and impedes the selection of a suitable candidate for, e.g., neurotechnological applications. Fostering component introspection, we propose to embrace this variability by condensing the functional signatures of a large set of oscillatory components into homogeneous clusters, each representing specific within-trial envelope dynamics. The proposed method is exemplified by and evaluated on a complex hand force task with a rich within-trial structure. Based on electroencephalography data of 18 healthy subjects, we found that the components' distinct temporal envelope dynamics are highly subject-specific. On average, we obtained seven clusters per subject, which were strictly confined regarding their underlying frequency bands. As the analysis method is not limited to a specific spatial filtering algorithm, it could be utilized for a wide range of neurotechnological applications, e.g., to select and monitor functionally relevant features for brain-computer interface protocols in stroke rehabilitation.

*abstract:* Cell nuclei detection is a challenging research topic because of limitations in cellular image quality and diversity of nuclear morphology, i.e. varying nuclei shapes, sizes, and overlaps between multiple cell nuclei. This has been a topic of enduring interest with promising recent success shown by deep learning methods. These methods train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with a training set of input images and known, labeled nuclei locations. Many such methods are supplemented by spatial or morphological processing. Using a set of canonical cell nuclei shapes, prepared with the help of a domain expert, we develop a new approach that we call Shape Priors with Convolutional Neural Networks (SP-CNN). We further extend the network to introduce a shape prior (SP) layer and then allowing it to become trainable (i.e. optimizable). We call this network tunable SP-CNN (TSP-CNN). In summary, we present new network structures that can incorporate 'expected behavior' of nucleus shapes via two components: learnable layers that perform the nucleus detection and a fixed processing part that guides the learning with prior information. Analytically, we formulate two new regularization terms that are targeted at: 1) learning the shapes, 2) reducing false positives while simultaneously encouraging detection inside the cell nucleus boundary. Experimental results on two challenging datasets reveal that the proposed SP-CNN and TSP-CNN can outperform state-of-the-art alternatives.

## 13. Joint Rain Detection and Removal from a Single Image with Contextualized Deep Networks.


*Journal: IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-28*

*abstract:* Rain streaks, particularly in heavy rain, not only degrade visibility but also make many computer vision algorithms fail to function properly. In this paper, we address this visibility problem by focusing on single-image rain removal, even in the presence of dense rain streaks and rain-streak accumulation, which is visually similar to mist or fog. To achieve this, we introduce a new rain model and a deep learning architecture. Our rain model incorporates a binary rain map indicating rain-streak regions, and accommodates various shapes, directions, and sizes of overlapping rain streaks, as well as rain accumulation, to model heavy rain. Based on this model, we construct a multi-task deep network, which jointly learns three targets: the binary rain-streak map, rain streak layers, and clean background, which is our ultimate output. To generate features that can be invariant to rain steaks, we introduce a contextual dilated network, which is able to exploit regional contextual information. To handle various shapes and directions of overlapping rain streaks, our strategy is to utilize a recurrent process that progressively removes rain streaks. Our binary map provides a constraint and thus additional information to train our network. Extensive evaluation on real images, particularly in heavy rain, shows the effectiveness of our model and architecture.

## 14. Deep Neural Generative Model of Functional MRI Images for Psychiatric Disorder Diagnosis.


*Journal: IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-28*

[https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2019.2895663](https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2019.2895663){: .btn}

*abstract:* Accurate diagnosis of psychiatric disorders plays a critical role in improving the quality of life for patients and potentially supports the development of new treatments. Many studies have been conducted on machine learning techniques that seek brain imaging data for specific biomarkers of disorders. These studies have encountered the following dilemma: An end-to-end classification overfits to a small number of high-dimensional samples but unsupervised feature-extraction has the risk of extracting a signal of no interest. In addition, such studies often provided only diagnoses for patients without presenting the reasons for these diagnoses. This study proposed a deep neural generative model of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. The proposed model is conditioned by the assumption of the subject's state and estimates the posterior probability of the subject's state given the imaging data, using Bayes' rule. This study applied the proposed model to diagnose schizophrenia and bipolar disorders. Diagnostic accuracy was improved by a large margin over competitive approaches, namely classifications of functional connectivity and discriminative/generative models of region-wise signals with or without unsupervised feature-extractors. The proposed model visualizes brain regions largely related to the disorders, thus motivating further biological investigation.

## 15. Comprehensive and empirical evaluation of machine learning algorithms for small molecule LC retention time prediction.


*Journal: Analytical chemistry* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-31*

*abstract:* Liquid chromatography is a core component of almost all mass spectrometric analyses of (bio)molecules. Because of the high-throughput nature of mass spectrometric analyses, the interpretation of these chromatographic data increasingly relies on informatics solutions that attempt to predict an analyte's retention time. The key components of such predictive algorithms are the features these are supplies with, and the actual machine learning algorithm used to fit the model parameters. Therefore, we have evaluated the performance of seven machine learning algorithms on 36 distinct metabolomics data sets, using two distinct feature sets. Interestingly, the results show that no single learning algorithm performs optimally for all data sets, with different types of algorithms achieving top performance for different types of analytes or different protocols. Our results thus show that an evaluation of machine learning algorithms for retention time prediction is needed to find a suitable algorithm for specific analytes or protocols. Importantly, however, our results also show that blending different types of models together decreases the error on outliers, indicating that the combination of several approaches holds substantial promise for the development of more generic, high-performing algorithms.

*abstract:* The Paris System for Urine Cytopathology (the Paris System) has succeeded in making the analysis of liquid-based urine preparations more reproducible. Any algorithm seeking to automate this system must accurately estimate the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic (N:C) ratio and produce a qualitative "atypia score." The authors propose a hybrid deep-learning and morphometric model that reliably automates the Paris System.

*abstract:* The in vitro MultiFlow® DNA Damage Assay multiplexes γH2AX, p53, phospho-histone H3, and polyploidization biomarkers into a single flow cytometric analysis [Bryce et al., 2016]. The current report describes a tiered, sequential data analysis strategy based on data generated from exposure of human TK6 cells to a previously described 85 chemical training set and a new pharmaceutical-centric test set (n=40). In each case, exposure was continuous over a range of closely spaced concentrations, and cell aliquots were removed for analysis following 4 and 24 hr of treatment. The first data analysis step focused on chemicals' genotoxic potential, and for this purpose we evaluated the performance of a machine learning (ML) ensemble, a rubric that considered fold increases in biomarkers against global evaluation factors (GEFs), and a hybrid strategy that considered ML and GEFs. This first tier further used ML output and/or GEFs to classify genotoxic activity as clastogenic and/or aneugenic. Test set results demonstrated the generalizability of the first tier, with particularly good performance from the ML ensemble: 35/40 (88%) concordance with a priori genotoxicity expectations and 21/24 (88%) agreement with expected mode of action (MoA). A second tier applied unsupervised hierarchical clustering to the biomarker response data, and these analyses were found to group certain chemicals, especially aneugens, according to their molecular targets. Finally, a third tier utilized benchmark dose analyses and MultiFlow biomarker responses to rank genotoxic potency. The relevance of these rankings is supported by the strong agreement found between benchmark dose values derived from MultiFlow biomarkers compared to those generated from parallel in vitro micronucleus analyses. Collectively, the results suggest that a tiered MultiFlow data analysis pipeline is capable of rapidly and effectively identifying genotoxic hazards while providing additional information that is useful for modern risk assessments-MoA, molecular targets, and potency.

*abstract:* Reliable automated segmentation of the prostate is indispensable for image-guided prostate interventions. However, the segmentation task is challenging due to inhomogeneous intensity distributions, variation in prostate anatomy, among other problems. Manual segmentation can be time-consuming and is subject to inter- and intra-observer variation. We developed an automated deep learning-based method to address this technical challenge.

*abstract:* Smartphones enable the implementation of just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) that tailor the delivery of health interventions over time to user- and time-varying context characteristics. Ideally, JITAIs include effective intervention components, and delivery tailoring is based on effective moderators of intervention effects. Using machine learning techniques to infer each user's context from smartphone sensor data is a promising approach to further enhance tailoring.

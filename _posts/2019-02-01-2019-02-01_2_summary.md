#### [31. Temporal indexing of medical entity in Chinese clinical notes.](https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12911-019-0735-x){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Liu Zengjian, Wang Xiaolong, Chen Qingcai, Tang Buzhou, Xu Hua*

**Journal:** *BMC medical informatics and decision making*

*abstract:* The goal of temporal indexing is to select an occurred time or time interval for each medical entity in clinical notes, so that all medical entities can be indexed on a united timeline, which could assist the understanding of clinical notes and the further application of medical entities. Some temporal relation shared tasks for the medical entity in English clinical notes have been organized in the past few years, such as the 2012 i2b2 NLP challenge, 2015 and 2016 clinical TempEval challenges. In these tasks, many heuristics rule-based and machine learning-based systems have been developed. In recent years, the deep neural network models have shown great potential on many problems including the relation classification.

#### [32. Integrating shortest dependency path and sentence sequence into a deep learning framework for relation extraction in clinical text.](https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12911-019-0736-9){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Li Zhiheng, Yang Zhihao, Shen Chen, Xu Jun, Zhang Yaoyun, Xu Hua*

**Journal:** *BMC medical informatics and decision making*

*abstract:* Extracting relations between important clinical entities is critical but very challenging for natural language processing (NLP) in the medical domain. Researchers have applied deep learning-based approaches to clinical relation extraction; but most of them consider sentence sequence only, without modeling syntactic structures. The aim of this study was to utilize a deep neural network to capture the syntactic features and further improve the performances of relation extraction in clinical notes.

**Authors:** *Zhu Xiaoshu, Li Hong-Dong, Xu Yunpei, Guo Lilu, Wu Fang-Xiang, Duan Guihua, Wang Jianxin*

**Journal:** *Genes*

*abstract:* Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has recently brought new insight into cell differentiation processes and functional variation in cell subtypes from homogeneous cell populations. A lack of prior knowledge makes unsupervised machine learning methods, such as clustering, suitable for analyzing scRNA-seq . However, there are several limitations to overcome, including high dimensionality, clustering result instability, and parameter adjustment complexity. In this study, we propose a method by combining structure entropy and k nearest neighbor to identify cell subpopulations in scRNA-seq data. In contrast to existing clustering methods for identifying cell subtypes, minimized structure entropy results in natural communities without specifying the number of clusters. To investigate the performance of our model, we applied it to eight scRNA-seq datasets and compared our method with three existing methods (nonnegative matrix factorization, single-cell interpretation via multikernel learning, and structural entropy minimization principle). The experimental results showed that our approach achieves, on average, better performance in these datasets compared to the benchmark methods.

**Journal:** *Cancers*

*abstract:* Substantial alterations at the multi-omics level of pancreatic cancer (PC) impede the possibility to diagnose and treat patients in early stages. Herein, we conducted an integrative omics-based translational analysis, utilizing next-generation sequencing, transcriptome meta-analysis, and immunohistochemistry, combined with statistical learning, to validate multiplex biomarker candidates for the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of PC. Experiment-based validation was conducted and supportive evidence for the essentiality of the candidates in PC were found at gene expression or protein level by practical biochemical methods. Remarkably, the random forests (RF) model exhibited an excellent diagnostic performance and

#### [37. Spatial Reorganization of Myoelectric Activities in Extensor Digitorum for Sustained Finger Force Production.](http://www.mdpi.com/resolver?pii=s19030555){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Gao Zhixian, Tang Shangjie, Wu Xiaoying, Fu Qiang, Fan Xingyu, Zhao Yun, Hu Lintao, Chen Lin, Hou Wensheng*

**Journal:** *Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)*

*abstract:* The study aims to explore the spatial distribution of multi-tendinous muscle modulated by central nervous system (CNS) during sustained contraction. Nine subjects were recruited to trace constant target forces with right index finger extension. Surface electromyography (sEMG) of extensor digitorum (ED) were recorded with a 32-channel electrode array. Nine successive topographic maps (TM) were obtained. Pixel wise analysis was utilized to extract subtracted topographic maps (STM), which exhibited inhomogeneous distribution. STMs were characterized into hot, warm, and cool regions corresponding to higher, moderate, and lower change ranges, respectively. The relative normalized area (normalized to the first phase) of these regions demonstrated different changing trends as rising, plateauing, and falling over time, respectively. Moreover, the duration of these trends were found to be affected by force level. The rising/falling periods were longer at lower force levels, while the plateau can be achieved from the initial phase for higher force output (45% maximal voluntary contraction). The results suggested muscle activity reorganization in ED plays a role to maintain sustained contraction. Furthermore, the decreased dynamical regulation ability to spatial reorganization may be prone to induce fatigue. This finding implied that spatial reorganization of muscle activity as a regulation mechanism contribute to maintain constant force production.

#### [38. Deploying Acoustic Detection Algorithms on Low-Cost, Open-Source Acoustic Sensors for Environmental Monitoring.](http://www.mdpi.com/resolver?pii=s19030553){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Prince Peter, Hill Andrew, Pi√±a Covarrubias Evelyn, Doncaster Patrick, Snaddon Jake L, Rogers Alex*

**Journal:** *Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)*

*abstract:* Conservation researchers require low-cost access to acoustic monitoring technology. However, affordable tools are often constrained to short-term studies due to high energy consumption and limited storage. To enable long-term monitoring, energy and space efficiency must be improved on such tools. This paper describes the development and deployment of three acoustic detection algorithms that reduce the power and storage requirements of acoustic monitoring on affordable, open-source hardware. The algorithms aim to detect bat echolocation, to search for evidence of an endangered cicada species, and also to collect evidence of poaching in a protected nature reserve. The algorithms are designed to run on AudioMoth: a low-cost, open-source acoustic monitoring device, developed by the authors and widely adopted by the conservation community. Each algorithm addresses a detection task of increasing complexity, implementing extra analytical steps to account for environmental conditions such as wind, analysing samples multiple times to prevent missed events, and incorporating a hidden Markov model for sample classification in both the time and frequency domain. For each algorithm, we report on real-world deployments carried out with partner organisations and also benchmark the hidden Markov model against a convolutional neural network, a deep-learning technique commonly used for acoustics. The deployments demonstrate how acoustic detection algorithms extend the use of low-cost, open-source hardware and facilitate a new avenue for conservation researchers to perform large-scale monitoring.

#### [39. EEG Classification of Motor Imagery Using a Novel Deep Learning Framework.](http://www.mdpi.com/resolver?pii=s19030551){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Dai Mengxi, Zheng Dezhi, Na Rui, Wang Shuai, Zhang Shuailei*

**Journal:** *Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)*

*abstract:* Successful applications of brain-computer interface (BCI) approaches to motor imagery (MI) are still limited. In this paper, we propose a classification framework for MI electroencephalogram (EEG) signals that combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture with a variational autoencoder (VAE) for classification. The decoder of the VAE generates a Gaussian distribution, so it can be used to fit the Gaussian distribution of EEG signals. A new representation of input was developed by combining the time, frequency, and channel information from the EEG signal, and the CNN-VAE method was designed and optimized accordingly for this form of input. In this network, the classification of the extracted CNN features is performed via the deep network VAE. Our framework, with an average kappa value of 0.564, outperforms the best classification method in the literature for BCI Competition IV dataset 2b with a 3% improvement. Furthermore, using our own dataset, the CNN-VAE framework also yields the best performance for both three-electrode and five-electrode EEGs and achieves the best average kappa values 0.568 and 0.603, respectively. Our results show that the proposed CNN-VAE method raises performance to the current state of the art.

#### [40. Predicting Blood‚ÅªBrain Barrier Permeability of Marine-Derived Kinase Inhibitors Using Ensemble Classifiers Reveals Potential Hits for Neurodegenerative Disorders.](http://www.mdpi.com/resolver?pii=md17020081){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Plisson Fabien, Piggott Andrew M*

**Journal:** *Marine drugs*

*abstract:* The recent success of small-molecule kinase inhibitors as anticancer drugs has generated significant interest in their application to other clinical areas, such as disorders of the central nervous system (CNS). However, most kinase inhibitor drug candidates investigated to date have been ineffective at treating CNS disorders, mainly due to poor blood‚Åªbrain barrier (BBB) permeability. It is, therefore, imperative to evaluate new chemical entities for both kinase inhibition and BBB permeability. Over the last 35 years, marine biodiscovery has yielded 471 natural products reported as kinase inhibitors, yet very few have been evaluated for BBB permeability. In this study, we revisited these marine natural products and predicted their ability to cross the BBB by applying freely available open-source chemoinformatics and machine learning algorithms to a training set of 332 previously reported CNS-penetrant small molecules. We evaluated several regression and classification models, and found that our optimised classifiers (random forest, gradient boosting, and logistic regression) outperformed other models, with overall cross-validated model accuracies of 80%‚Åª82% and 78%‚Åª80% on external testing. All 3 binary classifiers predicted 13 marine-derived kinase inhibitors with appropriate physicochemical characteristics for BBB permeability.

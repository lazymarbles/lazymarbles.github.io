Across the natural world as well as the artificial worlds of maps, diagrams, and 
data visualizations, feature similarity (e.g., color and shape) links spatially
separate areas into sets. Despite a century of study, it is yet unclear what
mechanism underlies this gestalt similarity grouping. One recent proposal is that
similarity grouping-for example, seeing a red, vertical, or square group-is just 
global selection of those features. Although parsimonious, this account makes the
counterintuitive prediction that similarity grouping is strictly serial: A green 
group cannot be constructed at the same time as a red group. We tested this
prediction with a novel measure-a grouping illusion within number-estimation
tasks that should work only if participants simultaneously construct groups-and
found the strongest evidence yet in favor of serial feature-based attention ( Ns 
= 14, 12, and 12 for Experiment 1, Experiment 2, and Experiment 3, respectively).

OBJECTIVE: Radiology reports are rich resources for biomedical researchers.
Before utilization of radiology reports, experts must manually review these
reports to identify the categories. In fact, automatically categorizing
electronic medical record (EMR) text with key annotation is difficult because it 
has a free-text format. To address these problems, we developed an automated
system for disease annotation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Reports of musculoskeletal radiography examinations
performed from January 1, 2016, through December 31, 2016, were exported from the
database of Hanyang University Medical Center. After sentences not written in
English and sentences containing typos were excluded, 3032 sentences were
included. We built a system that uses a recurrent neural network (RNN) to
automatically identify fracture and nonfracture cases as a preliminary study. We 
trained and tested the system using orthopedic surgeon-classified reports. We
evaluated the system for the number of layers in the following two ways: the word
error rate of the output sentences and performance as a binary classifier using
standard evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
RESULTS: The word error rate using Levenshtein distance showed the best
performance in the three-layer model at 1.03%. The three-layer model also showed 
the highest overall performance with the highest precision (0.967), recall
(0.967), accuracy (0.982), and F1 score (0.967).
CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that the RNN-based system has the ability to
classify important findings in radiology reports with a high F1 score. We expect 
that our system can be used in cohort construction such as for retrospective
studies because it is efficient for analyzing a large amount of data.

Bacterial small (sRNAs) are involved in the control of several cellular
processes. Hundreds of putative sRNAs have been identified in many bacterial
species through RNA sequencing. The existence of putative sRNAs is usually
validated by Northern blot analysis. However, the large amount of novel putative 
sRNAs reported in the literature makes it impractical to validate each of them in
the wet lab. In this work, we applied five machine learning approaches to
construct twenty models to discriminate bona fide sRNAs from random genomic
sequences in five bacterial species. Sequences were represented using seven
features including free energy of their predicted secondary structure, their
distances to the closest predicted promoter site and Rho-independent terminator, 
and their distance to the closest open reading frames (ORFs). To automatically
calculate these features, we developed an sRNA Characterization Pipeline
(sRNACharP). All seven features used in the classification task contributed
positively to the performance of the predictive models. The best performing model
obtained a median precision of 100% at 10% recall and of 64% at 40% recall across
all five bacterial species, and it outperformed previous published approaches on 
two benchmark datasets in terms of precision and recall. Our results indicate
that even though there is limited sRNA sequence conservation across different
bacterial species, there are intrinsic features in the genomic context of sRNAs
that are conserved across taxa. We show that these features are utilized by
machine learning approaches to learn a species-independent model to prioritize
bona fide bacterial sRNAs.

Puppyhood is a very active social and vocal period in a harbor seal's life Phoca 
vitulina. An important feature of vocalizations is their temporal and rhythmic
structure, and understanding vocal timing and rhythms in harbor seals is critical
to a cross-species hypothesis in evolutionary neuroscience that links vocal
learning, rhythm perception, and synchronization. This study utilized analytical 
techniques that may best capture rhythmic structure in pup vocalizations with the
goal of examining whether (1) harbor seal pups show rhythmic structure in their
calls and (2) rhythms evolve over time. Calls of 3 wild-born seal pups were
recorded daily over the course of 1-3 weeks; 3 temporal features were analyzed
using 3 complementary techniques. We identified temporal and rhythmic structure
in pup calls across different time windows. The calls of harbor seal pups exhibit
some degree of temporal and rhythmic organization, which evolves over puppyhood
and resembles that of other species' interactive communication. We suggest next
steps for investigating call structure in harbor seal pups and propose
comparative hypotheses to test in other pinniped species.

A theory of general intelligence.

This paper proposes a theoretical framework for the biological learning mechanism
as a general learning system. The proposal is as follows. The bursting and tonic 
modes of firing patterns found in many neuron types in the brain correspond to
two separate modes of information processing, with one mode resulting in
awareness, and another mode being subliminal. In such a coding scheme, a neuron
in bursting state codes for the highest level of perceptual abstraction
representing a pattern of sensory stimuli, or volitional abstraction representing
a pattern of muscle contraction sequences. Within the 50-250 ms minimum
integration time of experience, the bursting neurons form synchrony ensembles to 
allow for binding of related percepts. The degree which different bursting
neurons can be merged into the same synchrony ensemble depends on the underlying 
cortical connections that represent the degree of perceptual similarity. These
synchrony ensembles compete for selective attention to remain active. The
dominant synchrony ensemble triggers episodic memory recall in the hippocampus,
while forming new episodic memory with current sensory stimuli, resulting in a
stream of thoughts. Neuromodulation modulates both top-down selection of
synchrony ensembles, and memory formation. Episodic memory stored in the
hippocampus is transferred to semantic and procedural memory in the cortex during
rapid eye movement sleep, by updating cortical neuron synaptic weights with spike
timing dependent plasticity. With the update of synaptic weights, new neurons
become bursting while previous bursting neurons become tonic, allowing bursting
neurons to move up to a higher level of perceptual abstraction. Finally, the
proposed learning mechanism is compared with the back-propagation algorithm used 
in deep neural networks, and a proposal of how the credit assignment problem can 
be addressed by the current theory is presented.

Recently, egocentric activity recognition has attracted considerable attention in
the pattern recognition and artificial intelligence communities because of its
wide applicability in medical care, smart homes, and security monitoring. In this
study, we developed and implemented a deep-learning-based hierarchical fusion
framework for the recognition of egocentric activities of daily living (ADLs) in 
a wearable hybrid sensor system comprising motion sensors and cameras. Long
short-term memory (LSTM) and a convolutional neural network are used to perform
egocentric ADL recognition based on motion sensor data and photo streaming in
different layers, respectively. The motion sensor data are used solely for
activity classification according to motion state, while the photo stream is used
for further specific activity recognition in the motion state groups. Thus, both 
motion sensor data and photo stream work in their most suitable classification
mode to significantly reduce the negative influence of sensor differences on the 
fusion results. Experimental results show that the proposed method not only is
more accurate than the existing direct fusion method (by up to 6%) but also
avoids the time-consuming computation of optical flow in the existing method,
which makes the proposed algorithm less complex and more suitable for practical
application.

A Mw 7.4 earthquake hit Donggala County, Central Sulawesi Province, Indonesia, on
28 September 2018, triggering a tsunami and liquefaction in Palu City and
Donggala. Around 2101 fatalities ensued and 68,451 houses were damaged by the
earthquake. In light of this devastating event, a post-earthquake map is required
to establish the first step in the evacuation and mitigation plan. In this study,
remote sensing imagery from the Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellites was used.
Pre- and post-earthquake satellite images were classified using artificial neural
network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers and processed using a 
decorrelation method to generate the post-earthquake damage map. The affected
areas were compared to the field data, the percentage conformity between the ANN 
and SVM results was analyzed, and four post-earthquake damage maps were
generated. Based on the conformity analysis, the Landsat-8 imagery (85.83%) was
superior to that of Sentinel-2 (63.88%). The resulting post-earthquake damage map
can be used to assess the distribution of seismic damage following the Palu
earthquake and may be used to mitigate damage in the event of future earthquakes.

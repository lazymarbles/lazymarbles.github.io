**Keywords:** **'Data integration', 'Data standardization', 'Dimensionality reduction', 'Machine learning', 'Medical informatics', 'Medical information systems', 'Semantic integration', 'UMLS'**

*Journal: Computers in biology and medicine* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-23*



*abstract:* Utilization of existing clinical data for improving patient outcomes poses a number of challenging and complex problems involving lack of data integration, the absence of standardization across inhomogeneous data sources and computationally-demanding and time-consuming exploration of very large datasets. In this paper, we will present a robust semantic data integration, standardization and dimensionality reduction method to tackle and solve these problems. Our approach enables the integration of clinical data from diverse sources by resolving canonical inconsistencies and semantic heterogeneity as required by the National Library of Medicine's Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) to produce standardized medical data. Through a combined application of rule-based semantic networks and machine learning, our approach enables a large reduction in dimensionality of the data and thus allows for fast and efficient application of data mining techniques to large clinical datasets. An example application of the techniques developed in our study is presented for the prediction of bariatric surgery outcomes.

*Journal: The Science of the total environment* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-26*



*abstract:* Landslides are major hazards for human activities often causing great damage to human lives and infrastructure. Therefore, the main aim of the present study is to evaluate and compare three machine learning algorithms (MLAs) including Naïve Bayes (NB), radial basis function (RBF) Classifier, and RBF Network for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) at Longhai area in China. A total of 14 landslide conditioning factors were obtained from various data sources, then the frequency ratio (FR) and support vector machine (SVM) methods were used for the correlation and selection the most important factors for modelling process, respectively. Subsequently, the resulting three models were validated and compared using some statistical metrics including area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) curve, and Friedman and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests The results indicated that the RBF Classifier model had the highest goodness-of-fit and performance based on the training and validation datasets. The results concluded that the RBF Classifier model outperformed and outclassed (AUROC = 0.881), the NB (AUROC = 0.872) and the RBF Network (AUROC = 0.854) models. The obtained results pointed out that the RBF Classifier model is a promising method for spatial prediction of landslide over the world.

**Keywords:** **'AST', 'BUN', 'CTP', 'Hemoglobin', 'INR', 'risk analysis'**

*Journal: Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-29*



*abstract:* Many patients with cirrhosis who undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) screening for esophageal varices (EVs) are found to have no or only small EVs. Endoscopic screening for EVs is therefore a potentially deferrable procedure that increases patient risk and healthcare cost. We developed and validated a scoring system, based on readily-available data, to identify patients with EVs varices that need treatment.

## 4. Effort-aware and just-in-time defect prediction with neural network.


*Journal: PloS one* *Publication Date: 2019*



*abstract:* Effort-aware just-in-time (JIT) defect prediction is to rank source code changes based on the likelihood of detects as well as the effort to inspect such changes. Accurate defect prediction algorithms help to find more defects with limited effort. To improve the accuracy of defect prediction, in this paper, we propose a deep learning based approach for effort-aware just-in-time defect prediction. The key idea of the proposed approach is that neural network and deep learning could be exploited to select useful features for defect prediction because they have been proved excellent at selecting useful features for classification and regression. First, we preprocess ten numerical metrics of code changes, and then feed them to a neural network whose output indicates how likely the code change under test contains bugs. Second, we compute the benefit cost ratio for each code change by dividing the likelihood by its size. Finally, we rank code changes according to their benefit cost ratio. Evaluation results on a well-known data set suggest that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on each of the subject projects. It improves the average recall and popt by 15.6% and 8.1%, respectively.

**Keywords:** **'Neglected diseases', 'antitubercular targets', 'ligand-based', 'machine learning ', 'structure-based'**

*Journal: Current computer-aided drug design* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-30*



*abstract:* Tuberculosis, malaria, dengue, chikungunya, leishmaniasis etc. are a large group of neglected tropical diseases that prevail in tropical and subtropical countries, affecting one billion people every year. Minimal funding and grants for research on these scientific problems challenge many researcher to find a different way to reduce the extensive time and cost involved in the drug discovery cycle of these problems. Computer-aided drug design techniques have already been proved successful in discovery of new molecules rationally by reducing the time and cost involved in the development of drugs. In the current minireview, we are highlighting on the molecular modeling studies published during 2010-2018 for target specific antitubercular agents. This review includes the studies of structure-based (SB) and ligand-based (LB) studies and those involving machine learning (ML) techniques against different antitubercular targets such as dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), enoyl acyl carrier protein (ACP) reductase (InhA), catalase-peroxidase (KatG), enzyme antigen 85C, protein tyrosine phosphatases (PtpA and PtpB), dUTPase, thioredoxin reductase (MtTrxR), etc. The information presented in this review will help the researchers to get acquainted with the recent progress in the modeling studies of antitubercular agents.

## 11. A contemporary review of machine learning in otolaryngology-head and neck surgery.
**Keywords:** **'Machine learning', 'and rhinology', 'artificial intelligence', 'head and neck oncology', 'laryngology', 'neural networks', 'neurotology'**

*Journal: The Laryngoscope* *Publication Date: 2019-Feb-01*



*abstract:* One of the key challenges with big data is leveraging the complex network of information to yield useful clinical insights. The confluence of massive amounts of health data and a desire to make inferences and insights on these data has produced a substantial amount of interest in machine-learning analytic methods. There has been a drastic increase in the otolaryngology literature volume describing novel applications of machine learning within the past 5 years. In this timely contemporary review, we provide an overview of popular machine-learning techniques, and review recent machine-learning applications in otolaryngology-head and neck surgery including neurotology, head and neck oncology, laryngology, and rhinology. Investigators have realized significant success in validated models with model sensitivities and specificities approaching 100%. Challenges remain in the implementation of machine-learning algorithms. This may be in part the unfamiliarity of these techniques to clinician leaders on the front lines of patient care. Spreading awareness and confidence in machine learning will follow with further validation and proof-of-value analyses that demonstrate model performance superiority over established methods. We are poised to see a greater influx of machine-learning applications to clinical problems in otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, and it is prudent for providers to understand the potential benefits and limitations of these technologies.

## 12. Recent technical development of artificial intelligence for diagnostic medical imaging.
**Keywords:** **'Artificial intelligence', 'Computer vision', 'Deep learning'**

*Journal: Japanese journal of radiology* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-31*



*abstract:* Deep learning has caused a third boom of artificial intelligence and great changes of diagnostic medical imaging systems such as radiology, pathology, retinal imaging, dermatology inspection, and endoscopic diagnosis will be expected in the near future. However, various attempts and new methods of deep learning have been proposed in recent years, and their progress is extremely fast. Therefore, at the initial stage when medical artificial intelligence papers were published, the artificial intelligence technology itself may be old technology or well-known general-purpose common technology. Therefore, the author has reviewed state-of-the-art computer vision papers and presentations of 2018 using deep learning technologies, which will have future clinical potentials selected from the point of view of a radiologist such as generative adversarial network, knowledge distillation, and general image data sets for supervised learning.

## 13. Meta-analysis of the moral brain: patterns of neural engagement assessed using multilevel kernel density analysis.
**Keywords:** **'MKDA', 'Machine learning', 'Meta-analysis', 'Moral', 'fMRI'**

*Journal: Brain imaging and behavior* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-31*



*abstract:* The neuroimaging literature in moral cognition has rapidly developed in the last decade with more than 200 publications on the topic. Neuroimaging based models generally agree that limbic regions work with medial prefrontal and temporal regions during moral processing to integrate emotional, social, and cognitive elements into decision-making. However, no quantitative work has been done examining neural response across types of moral cognition tasks. This paper uses Multilevel Kernel Density Analysis (MKDA) to conduct neuroimaging meta-analyses of the moral cognitive literature. MKDA replicated previous findings of the neural correlates of moral cognition: the left amygdala, medial prefrontal cortex, bilateral temporoparietal junction, and posterior cingulate. Random forest algorithms classified neural features as belonging to simple/utilitarian moral dilemmas, explicit/implicit moral tasks, and word/picture moral stimuli tasks; in combination with univariate contrast analyses, these results indicated a distinct pattern of processing for each of the members of these paradigm pairs. Overall, the results emphasize that the task selected for use in a moral cognition neuroimaging study is vital for the elicitation and interpretation of results. It also replicates and re-establishes the neural basis for moral processing, especially important in light of implementation errors in previous meta-analysis.

## 14. Predicting Breast Cancer Molecular Subtype with MRI Dataset Utilizing Convolutional Neural Network Algorithm.
**Keywords:** **'Breast MRI', 'CNN', 'Molecular subtype'**

*Journal: Journal of digital imaging* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-31*



*abstract:* To develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithm that can predict the molecular subtype of a breast cancer based on MRI features. An IRB-approved study was performed in 216 patients with available pre-treatment MRIs and immunohistochemical staining pathology data. First post-contrast MRI images were used for 3D segmentation using 3D slicer. A CNN architecture was designed with 14 layers. Residual connections were used in the earlier layers to allow stabilization of gradients during backpropagation. Inception style layers were utilized deeper in the network to allow learned segregation of more complex feature mappings. Extensive regularization was utilized including dropout, L2, feature map dropout, and transition layers. The class imbalance was addressed by doubling the input of underrepresented classes and utilizing a class sensitive cost function. Parameters were tuned based on a 20% validation group. A class balanced holdout set of 40 patients was utilized as the testing set. Software code was written in Python using the TensorFlow module on a Linux workstation with one NVidia Titan X GPU. Seventy-four luminal A, 106 luminal B, 13 HER2+, and 23 basal breast tumors were evaluated. Testing set accuracy was measured at 70%. The class normalized macro area under receiver operating curve (ROC) was measured at 0.853. Non-normalized micro-aggregated AUC was measured at 0.871, representing improved discriminatory power for the highly represented Luminal A and Luminal B subtypes. Aggregate sensitivity and specificity was measured at 0.603 and 0.958. MRI analysis of breast cancers utilizing a novel CNN can predict the molecular subtype of breast cancers. Larger data sets will likely improve our model.

## 15. Twitter Health Surveillance (THS) System.
**Keywords:** **'Twitter', 'big data analytics', 'deep learning', 'disease detection', 'streaming'**

*Journal: Proceedings : ... IEEE International Conference on Big Data. IEEE International Conference on Big Data* *Publication Date: 2018-Dec*



*abstract:* We present the Twitter Health Surveillance (THS) application framework. THS is designed as an integrated platform to help health officials collect tweets, determine if they are related with a medical condition, extract metadata out of them, and create a big data warehouse that can be used to further analyze the data. THS is built atop open source tools and provides the following value added services: Data Acquisition, Tweet Classification, and Big Data Warehousing. In order to validate THS, we have created a collection of roughly twelve thousands labelled tweets. These tweets contain one or more target medical terms, and the labels indicate if the tweet is related or not to a medical condition. We used this collection to test various models based on LSTM and GRU recurrent neural networks. Our experiments show that we can classify tweets with 96% precision, 92% recall, and 91% F1 score. These results compare favorably with recent research on this area, and show the promise of our THS system.

## 17. Machine Learning in Health Care: A Critical Appraisal of Challenges and Opportunities.
**Keywords:** **'data science', 'information technology', 'learning health', 'machine learning', 'translational research'**

*Journal: EGEMS (Washington, DC)* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-24*



*abstract:* Examples of fully integrated machine learning models that drive clinical care are rare. Despite major advances in the development of methodologies that outperform clinical experts and growing prominence of machine learning in mainstream medical literature, major challenges remain. At Duke Health, we are in our fourth year developing, piloting, and implementing machine learning technologies in clinical care. To advance the translation of machine learning into clinical care, health system leaders must address barriers to progress and make strategic investments necessary to bring health care into a new digital age. Machine learning can improve clinical workflows in subtle ways that are distinct from how statistics has shaped medicine. However, most machine learning research occurs in siloes, and there are important, unresolved questions about how to retrain and validate models post-deployment. Academic medical centers that cultivate and value transdisciplinary collaboration are ideally suited to integrate machine learning in clinical care. Along with fostering collaborative environments, health system leaders must invest in developing new capabilities within the workforce and technology infrastructure beyond standard electronic health records. Now is the opportunity to break down barriers and achieve scalable growth in the number of high-impact collaborations between clinical researchers and machine learning experts to transform clinical care.

*Journal: Asia Oceania journal of nuclear medicine & biology* *Publication Date: 2019*



*abstract:* Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) examination is commonly used for the evaluation of pulmonary nodules since it provides both anatomical and functional information. However, given the dependence of this evaluation on physician's subjective judgment, the results could be variable. The purpose of this study was to develop an automated scheme for the classification of pulmonary nodules using early and delayed phase PET/CT and conventional CT images.

## 19. Integrated Cognitive Assessment: Speed and Accuracy of Visual Processing as a Reliable Proxy to Cognitive Performance.


*Journal: Scientific reports* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-31*



*abstract:* Various mental disorders are accompanied by some degree of cognitive impairment. Particularly in neurodegenerative disorders, cognitive impairment is the phenotypical hallmark of the disease. Effective, accurate and timely cognitive assessment is key to early diagnosis of this family of mental disorders. Current standard-of-care techniques for cognitive assessment are primarily paper-based, and need to be administered by a healthcare professional; they are additionally language and education-dependent and typically suffer from a learning bias. These tests are thus not ideal for large-scale pro-active cognitive screening and disease progression monitoring. We developed the Integrated Cognitive Assessment (referred to as CGN_ICA), a 5-minute computerized cognitive assessment tool based on a rapid visual categorization task, in which a series of carefully selected natural images of varied difficulty are presented to participants. Overall 448 participants, across a wide age-range with different levels of education took the CGN_ICA test. We compared participants' CGN_ICA test results with a variety of standard pen-and-paper tests, such as Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) and Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), that are routinely used to assess cognitive performance. CGN_ICA had excellent test-retest reliability, showed convergent validity with the standard-of-care cognitive tests used here, and demonstrated to be suitable for micro-monitoring of cognitive performance.

## 20. High resolution mapping of a cold water coral mound.


*Journal: Scientific reports* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-31*



*abstract:* Cold-water coral (CWC) mounds are biogenic, long-lived morphostructures composed primarily by scleractinian CWC's and hemipelagic sediments that form complex deep-sea microhabitats found globally but specifically along the European-Atlantic margin. In this work, high-resolution mapping was applied to identify individual organismal distribution and zonation across a CWC Piddington Mound within the Porcupine Seabight, Ireland Margin. Marine Object-Based Image Analysis (MOBIA) and different machine learning classification methods (decision tree, logistic regression, and deep neural network) were applied to a high-resolution (2 mm) reef-scale video mosaic and ROV-mounted multibeam data in order to provide new insights into the spatial organization of coral frameworks and environmental factors on CWC mounds. The results showed an accurate quantification of the amount of Coral Framework (14.5%; ~2% live and ~12.5% dead) and sponges (~3.5%) with heterogeneous distribution, restricted to a certain portion of the mound. This is the first object level quantification of live and dead coral framework facies and individual sponges across an entire CWC mound. This approach has application for habitat and conservation studies, provides a quantification tool for carbon budget assessments and can provide a baseline to assess CWC mound change. The approach can also be modified for application in other habitats.

## 21. A feasibility study for predicting optimal radiation therapy dose distributions of prostate cancer patients from patient anatomy using deep learning.


*Journal: Scientific reports* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-31*



*abstract:* With the advancement of treatment modalities in radiation therapy for cancer patients, outcomes have improved, but at the cost of increased treatment plan complexity and planning time. The accurate prediction of dose distributions would alleviate this issue by guiding clinical plan optimization to save time and maintain high quality plans. We have modified a convolutional deep network model, U-net (originally designed for segmentation purposes), for predicting dose from patient image contours of the planning target volume (PTV) and organs at risk (OAR). We show that, as an example, we are able to accurately predict the dose of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for prostate cancer patients, where the average Dice similarity coefficient is 0.91 when comparing the predicted vs. true isodose volumes between 0% and 100% of the prescription dose. The average value of the absolute differences in [max, mean] dose is found to be under 5% of the prescription dose, specifically for each structure is [1.80%, 1.03%](PTV), [1.94%, 4.22%](Bladder), [1.80%, 0.48%](Body), [3.87%, 1.79%](L Femoral Head), [5.07%, 2.55%](R Femoral Head), and [1.26%, 1.62%](Rectum) of the prescription dose. We thus managed to map a desired radiation dose distribution from a patient's PTV and OAR contours. As an additional advantage, relatively little data was used in the techniques and models described in this paper.

## 22. Discovering highly selective and diverse PPAR-delta agonists by ligand based machine learning and structural modeling.


*Journal: Scientific reports* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-31*



*abstract:* PPAR-δ agonists are known to enhance fatty acid metabolism, preserving glucose and physical endurance and are suggested as candidates for treating metabolic diseases. None have reached the clinic yet. Our Machine Learning algorithm called "Iterative Stochastic Elimination" (ISE) was applied to construct a ligand-based multi-filter ranking model to distinguish between confirmed PPAR-δ agonists and random molecules. Virtual screening of 1.56 million molecules by this model picked ~2500 top ranking molecules. Subsequent docking to PPAR-δ structures was mainly evaluated by geometric analysis of the docking poses rather than by energy criteria, leading to a set of 306 molecules that were sent for testing in vitro. Out of those, 13 molecules were found as potential PPAR-δ agonist leads with EC

## 23. Multi-Channel 3D Deep Feature Learning for Survival Time Prediction of Brain Tumor Patients Using Multi-Modal Neuroimages.


*Journal: Scientific reports* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-31*



*abstract:* High-grade gliomas are the most aggressive malignant brain tumors. Accurate pre-operative prognosis for this cohort can lead to better treatment planning. Conventional survival prediction based on clinical information is subjective and could be inaccurate. Recent radiomics studies have shown better prognosis by using carefully-engineered image features from magnetic resonance images (MRI). However, feature engineering is usually time consuming, laborious and subjective. Most importantly, the engineered features cannot effectively encode other predictive but implicit information provided by multi-modal neuroimages. We propose a two-stage learning-based method to predict the overall survival (OS) time of high-grade gliomas patient. At the first stage, we adopt deep learning, a recently dominant technique of artificial intelligence, to automatically extract implicit and high-level features from multi-modal, multi-channel preoperative MRI such that the features are competent of predicting survival time. Specifically, we utilize not only contrast-enhanced T1 MRI, but also diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI), for computing multiple metric maps (including various diffusivity metric maps derived from DTI, and also the frequency-specific brain fluctuation amplitude maps and local functional connectivity anisotropy-related metric maps derived from rs-fMRI) from 68 high-grade glioma patients with different survival time. We propose a multi-channel architecture of 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for deep learning upon those metric maps, from which high-level predictive features are extracted for each individual patch of these maps. At the second stage, those deeply learned features along with the pivotal limited demographic and tumor-related features (such as age, tumor size and histological type) are fed into a support vector machine (SVM) to generate the final prediction result (i.e., long or short overall survival time). The experimental results demonstrate that this multi-model, multi-channel deep survival prediction framework achieves an accuracy of 90.66%, outperforming all the competing methods. This study indicates highly demanded effectiveness on prognosis of deep learning technique in neuro-oncological applications for better individualized treatment planning towards precision medicine.

## 24. Theories of Error Back-Propagation in the Brain.
**Keywords:** **'deep learning', 'neural networks', 'predictive coding', 'synaptic plasticity'**

*Journal: Trends in cognitive sciences* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-28*



*abstract:* This review article summarises recently proposed theories on how neural circuits in the brain could approximate the error back-propagation algorithm used by artificial neural networks. Computational models implementing these theories achieve learning as efficient as artificial neural networks, but they use simple synaptic plasticity rules based on activity of presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons. The models have similarities, such as including both feedforward and feedback connections, allowing information about error to propagate throughout the network. Furthermore, they incorporate experimental evidence on neural connectivity, responses, and plasticity. These models provide insights on how brain networks might be organised such that modification of synaptic weights on multiple levels of cortical hierarchy leads to improved performance on tasks.

*Journal: Clinical radiology* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-28*



*abstract:* Due to recent advances in artificial intelligence, there is renewed interest in automating interpretation of imaging tests. Chest radiographs are particularly interesting due to many factors: relatively inexpensive equipment, importance to public health, commonly performed throughout the world, and deceptively complex taking years to master. This article presents a brief introduction to artificial intelligence, reviews the progress to date in chest radiograph interpretation, and provides a snapshot of the available datasets and algorithms available to chest radiograph researchers. Finally, the limitations of artificial intelligence with respect to interpretation of imaging studies are discussed.

## 26. Selecting precise reference normal tissue samples for cancer research using a deep learning approach.
**Keywords:** **'Autoencoder', 'Deep learning', 'Disease signatures', 'Drug repositioning'**

*Journal: BMC medical genomics* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-31*



*abstract:* Normal tissue samples are often employed as a control for understanding disease mechanisms, however, collecting matched normal tissues from patients is difficult in many instances. In cancer research, for example, the open cancer resources such as TCGA and TARGET do not provide matched tissue samples for every cancer or cancer subtype. The recent GTEx project has profiled samples from healthy individuals, providing an excellent resource for this field, yet the feasibility of using GTEx samples as the reference remains unanswered.

**Keywords:** **'Cancer cell line encyclopedia', 'Deep neural networks', 'Drug response prediction', 'Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'The Cancer Genome Atlas'**

*Journal: BMC medical genomics* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-31*



*abstract:* The study of high-throughput genomic profiles from a pharmacogenomics viewpoint has provided unprecedented insights into the oncogenic features modulating drug response. A recent study screened for the response of a thousand human cancer cell lines to a wide collection of anti-cancer drugs and illuminated the link between cellular genotypes and vulnerability. However, due to essential differences between cell lines and tumors, to date the translation into predicting drug response in tumors remains challenging. Recently, advances in deep learning have revolutionized bioinformatics and introduced new techniques to the integration of genomic data. Its application on pharmacogenomics may fill the gap between genomics and drug response and improve the prediction of drug response in tumors.

## 28. Predict drug sensitivity of cancer cells with pathway activity inference.
**Keywords:** **'Cancer', 'Drug sensitivity', 'Machine learning', 'Pathway activity', 'Pharmacogenomics', 'Precision therapy'**

*Journal: BMC medical genomics* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-31*



*abstract:* Predicting cellular responses to drugs has been a major challenge for personalized drug therapy regimen. Recent pharmacogenomic studies measured the sensitivities of heterogeneous cell lines to numerous drugs, and provided valuable data resources to develop and validate computational approaches for the prediction of drug responses. Most of current approaches predict drug sensitivity by building prediction models with individual genes, which suffer from low reproducibility due to biologic variability and difficulty to interpret biological relevance of novel gene-drug associations. As an alternative, pathway activity scores derived from gene expression could predict drug response of cancer cells.

**Keywords:** **'deep learning', 'precise diagnosis', 'rotating machinery', 'structural faults', 'symptom parameters'**

*Journal: Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-30*



*abstract:* To precisely diagnose the rotating machinery structural faults, especially structural faults under low rotating speeds, a novel scheme based on combination of empirical mode decomposition (EMD), sample entropy, and deep belief network (DBN) is proposed in this paper. EMD can decompose a signal into several intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) with different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and sample entropy is performed to extract the signals that carry fault information with high SNR. The extracted fault signal is reconstructed into a new vibration signal that will carry abundant fault information. DBN has strong feature extraction and classification performance. It is suitably performed to build the diagnosis model based on the reconstructed signal. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by structural faults signal and the comparative experiments (BPNN, CNN, time-domain signal only, frequency-domain signal only). The results show that the diagnosis accuracy of the proposed method is between 99% and 100%, the BPNN is less than 25%, and the CNN is between 70% and 95%, which means the verified, proposed method has a superior performance to diagnose the structural fault.

**Keywords:** **'alpha-beta associative memories', 'assistive technologies', 'associative memory', 'correlation matrix', 'face recognition', 'facial expressions', 'impaired vision', 'k-nearest neighbors (KNN)'**

*Journal: Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-30*



*abstract:* Face recognition is a natural skill that a child performs from the first days of life; unfortunately, there are people with visual or neurological problems that prevent the individual from performing the process visually. This work describes a system that integrates Artificial Intelligence which learns the face of the people with whom the user interacts daily. During the study we propose a new hybrid model of Alpha-Beta Associative memories (Amαβ) with Correlation Matrix (CM) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), where the Amαβ-CMKNN was trained with characteristic biometric vectors generated from images of faces from people who present different facial expressions such as happiness, surprise, anger and sadness. To test the performance of the hybrid model, two experiments that differ in the selection of parameters that characterize the face are conducted. The performance of the proposed model was tested in the databases CK+, CAS-PEAL-R1 and Face-MECS (own), which test the Amαβ-CMKNN with faces of subjects of both sexes, different races, facial expressions, poses and environmental conditions. The hybrid model was able to remember 100% of all the faces learned during their training, while in the test in which faces are presented that have variations with respect to those learned the results range from 95.05% in controlled environments and 86.48% in real environments using the proposed integrated system.

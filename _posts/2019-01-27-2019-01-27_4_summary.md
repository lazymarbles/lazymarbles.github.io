*Journal: Scientific reports* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-24*

[http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-36946-4](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-36946-4){: .btn}

*abstract:* Due to the biogenesis difference, miRNAs can be divided into canonical microRNAs and mirtrons. Compared to canonical microRNAs, mirtrons are less conserved and hard to be identified. Except stringent annotations based on experiments, many in silico computational methods have be developed to classify miRNAs. Although several machine learning classifiers delivered high classification performance, all the predictors depended heavily on the selection of calculated features. Here, we introduced nucleotide-level convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for pre-miRNAs classification. By using "one-hot" encoding and padding, pre-miRNAs were converted into matrixes with the same shape. The convolution and max-pooling operations can automatically extract features from pre-miRNAs sequences. Evaluation on test dataset showed that our models had a satisfactory performance. Our investigation showed that it was feasible to apply CNNs to extract features from biological sequences. Since there are many hyperparameters can be tuned in CNNs, we believe that the performance of nucleotide-level convolutional neural networks can be greatly improved in the future.

## 32. Stratification of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients: a crowdsourcing approach.


*Journal: Scientific reports* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-24*

[http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-36873-4](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-36873-4){: .btn}

*abstract:* Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease where substantial heterogeneity in clinical presentation urgently requires a better stratification of patients for the development of drug trials and clinical care. In this study we explored stratification through a crowdsourcing approach, the DREAM Prize4Life ALS Stratification Challenge. Using data from >10,000 patients from ALS clinical trials and 1479 patients from community-based patient registers, more than 30 teams developed new approaches for machine learning and clustering, outperforming the best current predictions of disease outcome. We propose a new method to integrate and analyze patient clusters across methods, showing a clear pattern of consistent and clinically relevant sub-groups of patients that also enabled the reliable classification of new patients. Our analyses reveal novel insights in ALS and describe for the first time the potential of a crowdsourcing to uncover hidden patient sub-populations, and to accelerate disease understanding and therapeutic development.

## 33. Identifying outbreaks of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea virus through animal movements and spatial neighborhoods.


*Journal: Scientific reports* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-24*

[http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-36934-8](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-36934-8){: .btn}

*abstract:* The spread of pathogens in swine populations is in part determined by movements of animals between farms. However, understanding additional characteristics that predict disease outbreaks and uncovering landscape factors related to between-farm spread are crucial steps toward risk mitigation. This study integrates animal movements with environmental risk factors to identify the occurrence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) outbreaks. Using weekly farm-level incidence data from 332 sow farms, we applied machine-learning algorithms to quantify associations between risk factors and PEDV outbreaks with the ultimate goal of training predictive models and to identify the most important factors associated with PEDV occurrence. Our best algorithm was able to correctly predict whether an outbreak occurred during one-week periods with >80% accuracy. The most important predictors included pig movements into neighboring farms. Other important neighborhood attributes included hog density, environmental and weather factors such as vegetation, wind speed, temperature, and precipitation, and topographical features such as slope. Our neighborhood-based approach allowed us to simultaneously capture disease risks associated with long-distance animal movement as well as local spatial dynamics. The model presented here forms the foundation for near real-time disease mapping and will advance disease surveillance and control for endemic swine pathogens in the United States.

## 34. Learning from Longitudinal Data in Electronic Health Record and Genetic Data to Improve Cardiovascular Event Prediction.


*Journal: Scientific reports* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-24*

[http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-36745-x](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-36745-x){: .btn}

*abstract:* Current approaches to predicting a cardiovascular disease (CVD) event rely on conventional risk factors and cross-sectional data. In this study, we applied machine learning and deep learning models to 10-year CVD event prediction by using longitudinal electronic health record (EHR) and genetic data. Our study cohort included 109, 490 individuals. In the first experiment, we extracted aggregated and longitudinal features from EHR. We applied logistic regression, random forests, gradient boosting trees, convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks with long short-term memory (LSTM) units. In the second experiment, we applied a late-fusion approach to incorporate genetic features. We compared the performance with approaches currently utilized in routine clinical practice - American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Pooled Cohort Risk Equation. Our results indicated that incorporating longitudinal feature lead to better event prediction. Combining genetic features through a late-fusion approach can further improve CVD prediction, underscoring the importance of integrating relevant genetic data whenever available.

## 35. Simulating the NaK Eutectic Alloy with Monte Carlo and Machine Learning.


*Journal: Scientific reports* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-24*

[http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-36574-y](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-36574-y){: .btn}

*abstract:* Combining atomistic simulations and machine learning techniques can expedite significantly the materials discovery process. We present an application of such methodological combination for the prediction of the melting transition and amorphous-solid behavior of the NaK alloy at the eutectic concentration. We show that efficient prediction of these properties is possible via machine learning methods trained on the topological local structural properties. The configurations resulting from Monte Carlo annealing of the NaK eutectic alloy are analyzed with topological attributes based on the Voronoi tessellation and using expectation-maximization clustering and Random Forest classification. We show that the Voronoi topological fingerprints make an accurate and fast prediction of the alloy thermal behavior by cataloguing the atomic configurations into three distinct phases: liquid, amorphous solid, and crystalline solid. Melting is found at 230 K by the sharp split of configurations classified as crystalline solid and as liquid. With the proposed metrics, an arrest-motion temperature is identified at 130-140 K through a top down clustering of the atomic configurations catalogued as amorphous solid. This statistical learning paradigm is not restricted to eutectic alloys or thermodynamics, extends the utility of topological attributes in a significant way, and harnesses the discovery of new material properties.

## 36. Collaborative efforts to forecast seasonal influenza in the United States, 2015-2016.


*Journal: Scientific reports* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-24*

[http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-36361-9](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-36361-9){: .btn}

*abstract:* Since 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has hosted an annual influenza season forecasting challenge. The 2015-2016 challenge consisted of weekly probabilistic forecasts of multiple targets, including fourteen models submitted by eleven teams. Forecast skill was evaluated using a modified logarithmic score. We averaged submitted forecasts into a mean ensemble model and compared them against predictions based on historical trends. Forecast skill was highest for seasonal peak intensity and short-term forecasts, while forecast skill for timing of season onset and peak week was generally low. Higher forecast skill was associated with team participation in previous influenza forecasting challenges and utilization of ensemble forecasting techniques. The mean ensemble consistently performed well and outperformed historical trend predictions. CDC and contributing teams will continue to advance influenza forecasting and work to improve the accuracy and reliability of forecasts to facilitate increased incorporation into public health response efforts.

## 37. Diverse motif ensembles specify non-redundant DNA binding activities of AP-1 family members in macrophages.


*Journal: Nature communications* *Publication Date: 2019-01-24*

[http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-08236-0](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-018-08236-0){: .btn}

*abstract:* Mechanisms by which members of the AP-1 family of transcription factors play non-redundant biological roles despite recognizing the same DNA sequence remain poorly understood. To address this question, here we investigate the molecular functions and genome-wide DNA binding patterns of AP-1 family members in primary and immortalized mouse macrophages. ChIP-sequencing shows overlapping and distinct binding profiles for each factor that were remodeled following TLR4 ligation. Development of a machine learning approach that jointly weighs hundreds of DNA recognition elements yields dozens of motifs predicted to drive factor-specific binding profiles. Machine learning-based predictions are confirmed by analysis of the effects of mutations in genetically diverse mice and by loss of function experiments. These findings provide evidence that non-redundant genomic locations of different AP-1 family members in macrophages largely result from collaborative interactions with diverse, locus-specific ensembles of transcription factors and suggest a general mechanism for encoding functional specificities of their common recognition motif.

*abstract:* The analysis of physiological signals is ubiquitous in health and medical diagnosis as a primary tool for investigation and inquiry. Physiological signals are now being widely used for psychological and social fields. They have found promising application in the field of computer-based learning and tutoring. Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) is a fast-paced growing field which deals with the design and implementation of customized computer-based instruction and feedback methods without human intervention. This paper introduces the key concepts and motivations behind the use of physiological signals. It presents a detailed discussion and experimental comparison of ITS. The synergism of ITS and physiological signals in automated tutoring systems adapted to the learner's emotions and mental states are presented and compared. The insights are developed, and details are presented. The accuracy and classification methods of existing systems are highlighted as key areas of improvement. High-precision measurement systems and neural networks for machine-learning classification are deemed prospective directions for future improvements to existing systems.

*Journal: Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-23*

[http://www.mdpi.com/resolver?pii=s19030458](http://www.mdpi.com/resolver?pii=s19030458){: .btn}

*abstract:* Because the number of elderly people is predicted to increase quickly in the upcoming years, "aging in place" (which refers to living at home regardless of age and other factors) is becoming an important topic in the area of ambient assisted living. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a human physical activity recognition system based on data collected from smartphone sensors. The proposed approach implies developing a classifier using three sensors available on a smartphone: accelerometer, gyroscope, and gravity sensor. We have chosen to implement our solution on mobile phones because they are ubiquitous and do not require the subjects to carry additional sensors that might impede their activities. For our proposal, we target walking, running, sitting, standing, ascending, and descending stairs. We evaluate the solution against two datasets (an internal one collected by us and an external one) with great effect. Results show good accuracy for recognizing all six activities, with especially good results obtained for walking, running, sitting, and standing. The system is fully implemented on a mobile device as an Android application.

#### [1. EnsembleCNV: an ensemble machine learning algorithm to identify and genotype copy number variation using SNP array data.](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/nar/gkz068){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Zhang Zhongyang, Cheng Haoxiang, Hong Xiumei, Di Narzo Antonio F, Franzen Oscar, Peng Shouneng, Ruusalepp Arno, Kovacic Jason C, Bjorkegren Johan L M, Wang Xiaobin, Hao Ke*
**Journal:** *Nucleic acids research*
*abstract:* The associations between diseases/traits and copy number variants (CNVs) have not been systematically investigated in genome-wide association studies (GWASs), primarily due to a lack of robust and accurate tools for CNV genotyping. Herein, we propose a novel ensemble learning framework, ensembleCNV, to detect and genotype CNVs using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array data. EnsembleCNV (a) identifies and eliminates batch effects at raw data level; (b) assembles individual CNV calls into CNV regions (CNVRs) from multiple existing callers with complementary strengths by a heuristic algorithm; (c) re-genotypes each CNVR with local likelihood model adjusted by global information across multiple CNVRs; (d) refines CNVR boundaries by local correlation structure in copy number intensities; (e) provides direct CNV genotyping accompanied with confidence score, directly accessible for downstream quality control and association analysis. Benchmarked on two large datasets, ensembleCNV outperformed competing methods and achieved a high call rate (93.3%) and reproducibility (98.6%), while concurrently achieving high sensitivity by capturing 85% of common CNVs documented in the 1000 Genomes Project. Given this CNV call rate and accuracy, which are comparable to SNP genotyping, we suggest ensembleCNV holds significant promise for performing genome-wide CNV association studies and investigating how CNVs predispose to human diseases.

#### [2. Precision immunoprofiling to reveal diagnostic signatures for latent tuberculosis infection and reactivation risk stratification.](https://academic.oup.com/ib/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/intbio/zyz001){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Robison Heather M, Escalante Patricio, Valera Enrique, Erskine Courtney L, Auvil Loretta, Sasieta Humberto C, Bushell Colleen, Welge Michael, Bailey Ryan C*

**Journal:** *Integrative biology : quantitative biosciences from nano to macro*

*abstract:* Latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is estimated in nearly one quarter of the world's population, and of those immunocompetent and infected ~10% will proceed to active tuberculosis (TB). Current diagnostics cannot definitively identify LTBI and provide no insight into reactivation risk, thereby defining an unmet diagnostic challenge of incredible global significance. We introduce a new machine-learning-driven approach to LTBI diagnostics that leverages a high throughput, multiplexed cytokine detection technology and powerful bioinformatics to reveal multi-marker signatures for LTBI diagnosis and risk stratification. This approach is enabled through an individualized normalization procedure that allows disease-relevant biomarker signatures to be revealed despite heterogeneity in basal immune response. Specifically, cytokines secreted from antigen-challenged peripheral blood mononuclear cells were detected using silicon photonic sensor arrays and multidimensional data correlation of individually-normalized immune responses revealed signatures important for LTBI status. These results demonstrate a powerful combination of multiplexed biomarker detection technologies, precision immune normalization, and feature selection algorithms that revealed positively correlated multi-biomarker signatures for LTBI status and reactivation risk stratification from a relatively simple blood-based assay.

#### [3. Transfer learning based deep CNN for segmentation and detection of mitoses in breast cancer histopathological images.](https://academic.oup.com/jmicro/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/jmicro/dfz002){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Wahab Noorul, Khan Asifullah, Lee Yeon Soo*

**Journal:** *Microscopy (Oxford, England)*

*abstract:* Segmentation and detection of mitotic nuclei is a challenging task. To address this problem, a Transfer Learning based fast and accurate system is proposed. To give the classifier a balanced dataset, this work exploits the concept of Transfer Learning by first using a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) for segmentation, and then another Hybrid-CNN (with Weights Transfer and custom layers) for classification of mitoses. First, mitotic nuclei are automatically annotated, based on the ground truth centroids. The segmentation module then segments mitotic nuclei and also produces some false positives. Finally, the detection module is trained on the patches from the segmentation module and performs the final detection. Fine-tuning based Transfer Learning reduced training time, provided good initial weights, and improved the detection rate with F-measure of 0.713 and 76% area under the precision-recall curve for the challenging task of mitosis detection.

**Authors:** *Annette Schaub, Peter Falkai*

**Journal:** *Schizophrenia bulletin*

*abstract:* The Sixth Kraepelin Symposium was held at the Department of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, University Hospital, LMU Munich in October 2018, covering reports from 12 working groups (Keith H. Nuechterlein, Ph.D., University of California, Los Angeles; Kim T. Mueser, Ph.D., Center for Psychiatric Rehabilitation, Boston University, U.S.A.; Dominic Dwyer, Ph.D, Hospital LMU, Munich; David Fowler, Ph.D. University of Sussex, Brighton, U.K.; Martin Hautzinger, Ph.D., University of Tübingen; Nikolaos Koutsouleris, M.D., Hospital LMU, Munich; Stephan Leucht, M.D., Technical University Munich, Munich; David Miklowitz, Ph.D., UCLA School of Medicine, Los Angeles. U.S.A.; Cornelius Schüle, M.D., Hospital LMU, Munich; Florian Seemüller. M.D., kbo-Lech-Mangfall Clinics for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Garmisch Partenkirchen; Carla Torrent, Ph.D., Institute of Neuroscience, University of Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain.) from the United States and Europe on understanding and treating cognitive impairment and depression in schizophrenia and affective disorders. Current psychological interventions to improve outcome in schizophrenia and affective disorder such as cognitive remediation, illness management, psychoeducational and cognitive therapy were focused on, as were evidence-based psychological and pharmacological treatment options, guidelines for treating cognitive deficits and depression in schizophrenia, Cochrane-meta-analysis of acute therapies, relapse prevention as well as supported withdrawal from medication. Prevention of cognitive dysfunction and symptom exacerbation was approached in terms of machine learning methods to revisit Kraepelin's illness distinctions, application of new strategies in order to increase the rate of social recovery in patients with first-episode psychosis as well as in terms of state of the art psychosocial interventions for bipolar disorder in adolescents. Finally, the dissemination of information to consumers and the contribution to the reduction of stereotypes in psychiatry was also part of the symposiums aims.

**Authors:** *Jovanović Gordana, Romanić Snježana Herceg, Stojić Andreja, Klinčić Darija, Sarić Marijana Matek, Letinić Judita Grzunov, Popović Aleksandar*

**Journal:** *Ecotoxicology and environmental safety*

*abstract:* This study used advanced statistical and machine learning methods to investigate organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in breast milk, assuming that in a complex biological mixture, the pollutants emitted from the same source or with similar properties are statistically interrelated and possibly exhibit non-linear dynamics. The elaborated analyses such as Unmix source apportionment characterized individual source groups, while guided regularized random forest indicated the pollutant dependence on the ortho-chlorine atom attached to the congener's phenyl ring and mother's age. Mutual associations among PCBs were further discussed, but the results implied they were mostly not related to child delivery. PCB congeners -153, -180, -170, -118, -156, -105, and -138 appeared to be compounds of the outmost importance for mutual prediction with reference to their interrelations regarding chemical structure and metabolic processes in the mother's body. Finally, machine learning methods, which provided prediction relative errors lower than 30% and correlation coefficients higher than 0.90, suggested a possible strong non-linear relationship among the pollutants and consequently, the complexity of their pathways in the breast milk.

#### [7. A machine learning approach to predict perceptual decisions: an insight into face pareidolia.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40708-019-0094-5){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Barik Kasturi, Daimi Syed Naser, Jones Rhiannon, Bhattacharya Joydeep, Saha Goutam*

**Journal:** *Brain informatics*

*abstract:* The perception of an external stimulus not only depends upon the characteristics of the stimulus but is also influenced by the ongoing brain activity prior to its presentation. In this work, we directly tested whether spontaneous electrical brain activities in prestimulus period could predict perceptual outcome in face pareidolia (visualizing face in noise images) on a trial-by-trial basis. Participants were presented with only noise images but with the prior information that some faces would be hidden in these images, while their electrical brain activities were recorded; participants reported their perceptual decision, face or no-face, on each trial. Using differential hemispheric asymmetry features based on large-scale neural oscillations in a machine learning classifier, we demonstrated that prestimulus brain activities could achieve a classification accuracy, discriminating face from no-face perception, of 75% across trials. The time-frequency features representing hemispheric asymmetry yielded the best classification performance, and prestimulus alpha oscillations were found to be mostly involved in predicting perceptual decision. These findings suggest a mechanism of how prior expectations in the prestimulus period may affect post-stimulus decision making.

#### [8. Using computer-vision and machine learning to automate facial coding of positive and negative affect intensity.](http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0211735){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Haines Nathaniel, Southward Matthew W, Cheavens Jennifer S, Beauchaine Theodore, Ahn Woo-Young*

**Journal:** *PloS one*

*abstract:* Facial expressions are fundamental to interpersonal communication, including social interaction, and allow people of different ages, cultures, and languages to quickly and reliably convey emotional information. Historically, facial expression research has followed from discrete emotion theories, which posit a limited number of distinct affective states that are represented with specific patterns of facial action. Much less work has focused on dimensional features of emotion, particularly positive and negative affect intensity. This is likely, in part, because achieving inter-rater reliability for facial action and affect intensity ratings is painstaking and labor-intensive. We use computer-vision and machine learning (CVML) to identify patterns of facial actions in 4,648 video recordings of 125 human participants, which show strong correspondences to positive and negative affect intensity ratings obtained from highly trained coders. Our results show that CVML can both (1) determine the importance of different facial actions that human coders use to derive positive and negative affective ratings when combined with interpretable machine learning methods, and (2) efficiently automate positive and negative affect intensity coding on large facial expression databases. Further, we show that CVML can be applied to individual human judges to infer which facial actions they use to generate perceptual emotion ratings from facial expressions.

**Journal:** *CA: a cancer journal for clinicians*

*abstract:* Judgement, as one of the core tenets of medicine, relies upon the integration of multilayered data with nuanced decision making. Cancer offers a unique context for medical decisions given not only its variegated forms with evolution of disease but also the need to take into account the individual condition of patients, their ability to receive treatment, and their responses to treatment. Challenges remain in the accurate detection, characterization, and monitoring of cancers despite improved technologies. Radiographic assessment of disease most commonly relies upon visual evaluations, the interpretations of which may be augmented by advanced computational analyses. In particular, artificial intelligence (AI) promises to make great strides in the qualitative interpretation of cancer imaging by expert clinicians, including volumetric delineation of tumors over time, extrapolation of the tumor genotype and biological course from its radiographic phenotype, prediction of clinical outcome, and assessment of the impact of disease and treatment on adjacent organs. AI may automate processes in the initial interpretation of images and shift the clinical workflow of radiographic detection, management decisions on whether or not to administer an intervention, and subsequent observation to a yet to be envisioned paradigm. Here, the authors review the current state of AI as applied to medical imaging of cancer and describe advances in 4 tumor types (lung, brain, breast, and prostate) to illustrate how common clinical problems are being addressed. Although most studies evaluating AI applications in oncology to date have not been vigorously validated for reproducibility and generalizability, the results do highlight increasingly concerted efforts in pushing AI technology to clinical use and to impact future directions in cancer care.

#### [10. An Automatic Surface Defect Inspection System for Automobiles Using Machine Vision Methods.](http://www.mdpi.com/resolver?pii=s19030644){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Zhou Qinbang, Chen Renwen, Huang Bin, Liu Chuan, Yu Jie, Yu Xiaoqing*

**Journal:** *Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)*

*abstract:* Automobile surface defects like scratches or dents occur during the process of manufacturing and cross-border transportation. This will affect consumers' first impression and the service life of the car itself. In most worldwide automobile industries, the inspection process is mainly performed by human vision, which is unstable and insufficient. The combination of artificial intelligence and the automobile industry shows promise nowadays. However, it is a challenge to inspect such defects in a computer system because of imbalanced illumination, specular highlight reflection, various reflection modes and limited defect features. This paper presents the design and implementation of a novel automatic inspection system (AIS) for automobile surface defects which are the located in or close to style lines, edges and handles. The system consists of image acquisition and image processing devices, operating in a closed environment and noncontact way with four LED light sources. Specifically, we use five plane-array Charge Coupled Device (CCD) cameras to collect images of the five sides of the automobile synchronously. Then the AIS extracts candidate defect regions from the vehicle body image by a multi-scale Hessian matrix fusion method. Finally, candidate defect regions are classified into pseudo-defects, dents and scratches by feature extraction (shape, size, statistics and divergence features) and a support vector machine algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that automatic inspection system can effectively reduce false detection of pseudo-defects produced by image noise and achieve accuracies of 95.6% in dent defects and 97.1% in scratch defects, which is suitable for customs inspection of imported vehicles.

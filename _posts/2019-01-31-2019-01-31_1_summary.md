*abstract:* Fourier ptychographic microscopy allows for the collection of images with a high space-bandwidth product at the cost of temporal resolution. In Fourier ptychographic microscopy, the light source of a conventional widefield microscope is replaced with a light-emitting diode (LED) matrix, and multiple images are collected with different LED illumination patterns. From these images, a higher-resolution image can be computationally reconstructed without sacrificing field-of-view. We use deep learning to achieve single-shot imaging without sacrificing the space-bandwidth product, reducing the acquisition time in Fourier ptychographic microscopy by a factor of 69. In our deep learning approach, a training dataset of high-resolution images is used to jointly optimize a single LED illumination pattern with the parameters of a reconstruction algorithm. Our work paves the way for high-throughput imaging in biological studies.

**Journal:** *Cells*

*abstract:* Lysine succinylation is a form of posttranslational modification of the proteins that play an essential functional role in every aspect of cell metabolism in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Aside from experimental identification of succinylation sites, there has been an intense effort geared towards the development of sequence-based prediction through machine learning, due to its promising and essential properties of being highly accurate, robust and cost-effective. In spite of these advantages, there are several problems that are in need of attention in the design and development of succinylation site predictors. Notwithstanding of many studies on the employment of machine learning approaches, few articles have examined this bioinformatics field in a systematic manner. Thus, we review the advancements regarding the current state-of-the-art prediction models, datasets, and online resources and illustrate the challenges and limitations to present a useful guideline for developing powerful succinylation site prediction tools.

#### [33. Optimizing the Predictive Ability of Machine Learning Methods for Landslide Susceptibility Mapping Using SMOTE for Lishui City in Zhejiang Province, China.](http://www.mdpi.com/resolver?pii=ijerph16030368){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Wang Yumiao, Wu Xueling, Chen Zhangjian, Ren Fu, Feng Luwei, Du Qingyun*

**Journal:** *International journal of environmental research and public health*

*abstract:* The main goal of this study was to use the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) to expand the quantity of landslide samples for machine learning methods (i.e., support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), artiÔ¨Åcial neural network (ANN), and random forest (RF)) to produce high-quality landslide susceptibility maps for Lishui City in Zhejiang Province, China. Landslide-related factors were extracted from topographic maps, geological maps, and satellite images. Twelve factors were selected as independent variables using correlation coefficient analysis and the neighborhood rough set (NRS) method. In total, 288 soil landslides were mapped using field surveys, historical records, and satellite images. The landslides were randomly divided into two datasets: 70% of all landslides were selected as the original training dataset and 30% were used for validation. Then, SMOTE was employed to generate datasets with sizes ranging from two to thirty times that of the training dataset to establish and compare the four machine learning methods for landslide susceptibility mapping. In addition, we used slope units to subdivide the terrain to determine the landslide susceptibility. Finally, the landslide susceptibility maps were validated using statistical indexes and the area under the curve (AUC). The results indicated that the performances of the four machine learning methods showed different levels of improvement as the sample sizes increased. The RF model exhibited a more substantial improvement (AUC improved by 24.12%) than did the ANN (18.94%), SVM (17.77%), and LR (3.00%) models. Furthermore, the ANN model achieved the highest predictive ability (AUC = 0.98), followed by the RF (AUC = 0.96), SVM (AUC = 0.94), and LR (AUC = 0.79) models. This approach significantly improves the performance of machine learning techniques for landslide susceptibility mapping, thereby providing a better tool for reducing the impacts of landslide disasters.

#### [34. A Hierarchical Deep Fusion Framework for Egocentric Activity Recognition Using a Wearable Hybrid Sensor System.](http://www.mdpi.com/resolver?pii=s19030546){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Yu Haibin, Pan Guoxiong, Pan Mian, Li Chong, Jia Wenyan, Zhang Li, Sun Mingui*

**Journal:** *Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)*

*abstract:* Recently, egocentric activity recognition has attracted considerable attention in the pattern recognition and artificial intelligence communities because of its wide applicability in medical care, smart homes, and security monitoring. In this study, we developed and implemented a deep-learning-based hierarchical fusion framework for the recognition of egocentric activities of daily living (ADLs) in a wearable hybrid sensor system comprising motion sensors and cameras. Long short-term memory (LSTM) and a convolutional neural network are used to perform egocentric ADL recognition based on motion sensor data and photo streaming in different layers, respectively. The motion sensor data are used solely for activity classification according to motion state, while the photo stream is used for further specific activity recognition in the motion state groups. Thus, both motion sensor data and photo stream work in their most suitable classification mode to significantly reduce the negative influence of sensor differences on the fusion results. Experimental results show that the proposed method not only is more accurate than the existing direct fusion method (by up to 6%) but also avoids the time-consuming computation of optical flow in the existing method, which makes the proposed algorithm less complex and more suitable for practical application.

#### [35. Machine Learning and Integrative Analysis of Biomedical Big Data.](http://www.mdpi.com/resolver?pii=genes10020087){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Mirza Bilal, Wang Wei, Wang Jie, Choi Howard, Chung Neo Christopher, Ping Peipei*

**Journal:** *Genes*

*abstract:* Recent developments in high-throughput technologies have accelerated the accumulation of massive amounts of omics data from multiple sources: genome, epigenome, transcriptome, proteome, metabolome, etc. Traditionally, data from each source (e.g., genome) is analyzed in isolation using statistical and machine learning (ML) methods. Integrative analysis of multi-omics and clinical data is key to new biomedical discoveries and advancements in precision medicine. However, data integration poses new computational challenges as well as exacerbates the ones associated with single-omics studies. Specialized computational approaches are required to effectively and efficiently perform integrative analysis of biomedical data acquired from diverse modalities. In this review, we discuss state-of-the-art ML-based approaches for tackling five specific computational challenges associated with integrative analysis: curse of dimensionality, data heterogeneity, missing data, class imbalance and scalability issues.

#### [36. An Artificial Intelligence Application for Post-Earthquake Damage Mapping in Palu, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia.](http://www.mdpi.com/resolver?pii=s19030542){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Syifa Mutiara, Kadavi Prima Riza, Lee Chang-Wook*

**Journal:** *Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)*

*abstract:* A Mw 7.4 earthquake hit Donggala County, Central Sulawesi Province, Indonesia, on 28 September 2018, triggering a tsunami and liquefaction in Palu City and Donggala. Around 2101 fatalities ensued and 68,451 houses were damaged by the earthquake. In light of this devastating event, a post-earthquake map is required to establish the first step in the evacuation and mitigation plan. In this study, remote sensing imagery from the Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellites was used. Pre- and post-earthquake satellite images were classified using artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers and processed using a decorrelation method to generate the post-earthquake damage map. The affected areas were compared to the field data, the percentage conformity between the ANN and SVM results was analyzed, and four post-earthquake damage maps were generated. Based on the conformity analysis, the Landsat-8 imagery (85.83%) was superior to that of Sentinel-2 (63.88%). The resulting post-earthquake damage map can be used to assess the distribution of seismic damage following the Palu earthquake and may be used to mitigate damage in the event of future earthquakes.

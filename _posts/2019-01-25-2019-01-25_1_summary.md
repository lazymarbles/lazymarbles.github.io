#### [21. A Reweighted Scheme to Improve the Representation of the Neural Autoregressive Distribution Estimator.](https://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/6401645){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Wang Zheng, Wu Qingbiao*

**Journal:** *Computational intelligence and neuroscience*

*abstract:* The neural autoregressive distribution estimator(NADE) is a competitive model for the task of density estimation in the field of machine learning. While NADE mainly focuses on the problem of estimating density, the ability for dealing with other tasks remains to be improved. In this paper, we introduce a simple and efficient reweighted scheme to modify the parameters of the learned NADE. We make use of the structure of NADE, and the weights are derived from the activations in the corresponding hidden layers. The experiments show that the features from unsupervised learning with our reweighted scheme would be more meaningful, and the performance of the initialization for neural networks has a significant improvement as well.

#### [22. Xrare: a machine learning method jointly modeling phenotypes and genetic evidence for rare disease diagnosis.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41436-019-0439-8){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Li Qigang, Zhao Keyan, Bustamante Carlos D, Ma Xin, Wong Wing H*

**Journal:** *Genetics in medicine : official journal of the American College of Medical Genetics*

*abstract:* Despite the successful progress next-generation sequencing technologies has achieved in diagnosing the genetic cause of rare Mendelian diseases, the current diagnostic rate is still far from satisfactory because of heterogeneity, imprecision, and noise in disease phenotype descriptions and insufficient utilization of expert knowledge in clinical genetics. To overcome these difficulties, we present a novel method called Xrare for the prioritization of causative gene variants in rare disease diagnosis.

#### [23. Physical characteristics not psychological state or trait characteristics predict motion during resting state fMRI.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-36699-0){: .btn}

*abstract:* Head motion (HM) during fMRI acquisition can significantly affect measures of brain activity or connectivity even after correction with preprocessing methods. Moreover, any systematic relationship between HM and variables of interest can introduce systematic bias. There is a large and growing interest in identifying neural biomarkers for psychiatric disorders using resting state fMRI (rsfMRI). However, the relationship between HM and different psychiatric symptoms domains is not well understood. The aim of this investigation was to determine whether psychiatric symptoms and other characteristics of the individual predict HM during rsfMRI. A sample of n = 464 participants (174 male) from the Tulsa1000, a naturalistic longitudinal study recruiting subjects with different levels of severity in mood/anxiety/substance use disorders based on the dimensional NIMH Research Domain Criteria framework was used for this study. Based on a machine learning (ML) pipeline with nested cross-validation to avoid overfitting, the stacked model with 15 anthropometric (like body mass index, BMI) and demographic (age and sex) variables identifies BMI and weight as the most important variables and explained 10.9 percent of the HM variance (95% CI: 9.9-11.8). In comparison ML models with 105 self-report measures for state and trait psychological characteristics identified nicotine and alcohol use variables as well as impulsivity inhibitory control variables but explain only 5 percent of HM variance (95% CI: 3.5-6.4). A combined ML model using all 120 variables did not perform significantly better than the model using only 15 physical variables (combined model 95% confidence interval: 10.2-12.4). Taken together, after considering physical variables, state or trait psychological characteristics do not provide additional power to predict motion during rsfMRI.

#### [24. Probabilistic Assessment of Glass Forming Ability Rules for Metallic Glasses Aided by Automated Analysis of Phase Diagrams.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-36224-3){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Dasgupta Aparajita, Broderick Scott R, Mack Connor, Kota Bhargava U, Subramanian Ramachandran, Setlur Srirangaraj, Govindaraju Venu, Rajan Krishna*

**Journal:** *Scientific reports*

*abstract:* The use of machine learning techniques to expedite the discovery and development of new materials is an essential step towards the acceleration of a new generation of domain-specific highly functional material systems. In this paper, we use the test case of bulk metallic glasses to highlight the key issues in the field of high throughput predictions and propose a new probabilistic analysis of rules for glass forming ability using rough set theory. This approach has been applied to a broad range of binary alloy compositions in order to predict new metallic glass compositions. Our data driven approach takes into account not only a broad variety of thermodynamic, structural and kinetic based criteria, but also incorporates qualitative and descriptive attributes associated with eutectic points in phase diagrams. For the latter, we demonstrate the use of automated machine learning methods that go far beyond text recognition approaches by also being able to interpret phase diagrams. When combined with structural descriptors, this approach provides the foundations to develop a hierarchical probabilistic predication tool that can rank the feasibility of glass formation.

**Journal:** *EBioMedicine*

*abstract:* Early diagnosis of skin cancer lesions by dermoscopy, the gold standard in dermatological imaging, calls for a diagnostic upscale. The aim of the study was to improve the accuracy of dermoscopic skin cancer diagnosis through use of novel deep learning (DL) algorithms. An additional sonification-derived diagnostic layer was added to the visual classification to increase sensitivity.

**Authors:** *Wu Meiqi, Yang Yingxi, Wang Hui, Xu Yan*

**Journal:** *BMC bioinformatics*

*abstract:* Lysine acetylation in protein is one of the most important post-translational modifications (PTMs). It plays an important role in essential biological processes and is related to various diseases. To obtain a comprehensive understanding of regulatory mechanism of lysine acetylation, the key is to identify lysine acetylation sites. Previously, several shallow machine learning algorithms had been applied to predict lysine modification sites in proteins. However, shallow machine learning has some disadvantages. For instance, it is not as effective as deep learning for processing big data.

*abstract:* Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, autoimmune disease which may result in a higher risk of cardiovascular (CV) events and stroke. Tissue characterization and risk stratification of patients with rheumatoid arthritis are a challenging problem. Risk stratification of RA patients using traditional risk factor-based calculators either underestimates or overestimates the CV risk. Advancements in medical imaging have facilitated early and accurate CV risk stratification compared to conventional cardiovascular risk calculators.

*abstract:* We propose a new deep learning based approach to provide more accurate whole-body PET/MRI attenuation correction in comparison to the Dixon-based four-segment method. We use activity and attenuation maps estimated using the maximum likelihood reconstruction of activity and attenuation (MLAA) algorithm as inputs to convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn a CT-derived attenuation map. 

## 7. REM sleep's unique associations with corticosterone regulation, apoptotic pathways, and behavior in chronic stress in mice.
**Keywords:** **'EEG theta power', 'anhedonia', 'depression', 'machine learning', 'transcriptome'**

*abstract:* One of sleep's putative functions is mediation of adaptation to waking experiences. Chronic stress is a common waking experience; however, which specific aspect of sleep is most responsive, and how sleep changes relate to behavioral disturbances and molecular correlates remain unknown. We quantified sleep, physical, endocrine, and behavioral variables, as well as the brain and blood transcriptome in mice exposed to 9 weeks of unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS). Comparing 46 phenotypic variables revealed that rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMS), corticosterone regulation, and coat state were most responsive to UCMS. REMS theta oscillations were enhanced, whereas delta oscillations in non-REMS were unaffected. Transcripts affected by UCMS in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and blood were associated with inflammatory and immune responses. A machine-learning approach controlling for unspecific UCMS effects identified transcriptomic predictor sets for REMS parameters that were enriched in 193 pathways, including some involved in stem cells, immune response, and apoptosis and survival. Only three pathways were enriched in predictor sets for non-REMS. Transcriptomic predictor sets for variation in REMS continuity and theta activity shared many pathways with corticosterone regulation, in particular pathways implicated in apoptosis and survival, including mitochondrial apoptotic machinery. Predictor sets for REMS and anhedonia shared pathways involved in oxidative stress, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. These data identify REMS as a core and early element of the response to chronic stress, and identify apoptosis and survival pathways as a putative mechanism by which REMS may mediate the response to stressful waking experiences.

*abstract:* Recently, mobile devices, such as smartphones, have been introduced into healthcare research to substitute paper diaries as data-collection tools in the home environment. Such devices support collecting patient data at different time points over a long period, resulting in clinical time-series data with high temporal complexity, such as time irregularities. Analysis of such time series poses new challenges for machine-learning techniques. The clinical context for the research discussed in this paper is home monitoring in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

*abstract:* Natural products (NPs) remain the most prolific resource for the development of smallmolecule drugs. Here we report a new machine learning approach that allows the identification of natural products with high accuracy. The method also generates similarity maps, which highlight atoms that contribute significantly to the classification of small molecules as a natural product or synthetic molecule. The method can hence be utilized to (i) identify natural products in large molecular libraries, (ii) quantify the natural product-likeness of small molecules, and (iii) visualize atoms in small molecules that are characteristic of natural products or synthetic molecules. The models are based on random forest classifiers trained on data sets consisting of more than 265,000 to 322,000 natural products and synthetic molecules. Two-dimensional molecular descriptors, MACCS keys and Morgan2 fingerprints were explored. On an independent test set the models reached areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.997 and Matthews correlation coefficients (MCCs) of 0.954 and higher. The method was further tested on data from the Dictionary of Natural Products, ChEMBL and other resources. The best-performing models are accessible as a free web service at http://npscout.zbh.uni-hamburg.de/npscout.

## 13. Integrated Management of Energy, Wellbeing and Health in the Next Generation of Smart Homes.

*abstract:* This contribution proposes an implementation for next generation smart homes, where heterogeneous data, coming from multiple sensors (medical, wellbeing, energy, contextual, etc.) and house equipment (smart fridge, smart TV, etc.), need to be managed, secured and visualized. As a first step, it focuses only on energy and health data. However, it aims to lay the foundations to manage any type of information towards the development of smart interactions with the house, which might include artificial intelligence and machine learning. These data are securely collected using a central Web of Things gateway, located inside the smart home. For the e-health part, a set of possible use-cases is provided, along with the current progress of the implantation. In this regard, the main idea is to link the next generation smart homes with external medical entities in order to provide, first, quick intervention in the event of an abnormality being detected, and to be able to provide basic medical services such as remote consultations with a doctor for a particular health issue. This vision can be very promising, particularly in rural areas, where access to medical services is difficult. As for the energy part, the aim is to collect users' energy consumption inside the smart home, which can be supplied from different sources (heat, water, gas, or electricity), and to enable the use of advanced algorithms to predict and manage local energy consumption and production (if any). This approach combines data collected from smart meters, operational information of the smart energy devices (the status of smart plugs), user's requests and external network signals such as energy prices. By using a home energy management system that accepts such input parameters, the operation of in-home devices and appliances can be optimally controlled according to different objectives (e.g., minimizing energy costs and maximizing user's comfort level).

## 14. Collaborative Sensing with Interactive Learning using Dynamic Intelligent Virtual Sensors.

*abstract:* Although the availability of sensor data is becoming prevalent across many domains, it still remains a challenge to make sense of the sensor data in an efficient and effective manner in order to provide users with relevant services. The concept of virtual sensors provides a step towards this goal, however they are often used to denote homogeneous types of data, generally retrieved from a predetermined group of sensors. The DIVS (Dynamic Intelligent Virtual Sensors) concept was introduced in previous work to extend and generalize the notion of a virtual sensor to a dynamic setting with heterogenous sensors. This paper introduces a refined version of the DIVS concept by integrating an interactive machine learning mechanism, which enables the system to take input from both the user and the physical world. The paper empirically validates some of the properties of the DIVS concept. In particular, we are concerned with the distribution of different budget allocations for labelled data, as well as proactive labelling user strategies. We report on results suggesting that a relatively good accuracy can be achieved despite a limited budget in an environment with dynamic sensor availability, while proactive labeling ensures further improvements in performance.

## 15. Hand Movement Classification Using Burg Reflection Coefficients.
**Keywords:** **'classification algorithms', 'electromyography', 'feature selection', 'hand movement', 'health monitoring', 'machine learning', 'maximum entropy reflection coefficients'**

*Journal: Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-24*

*abstract:* Classification of electromyographic signals has a wide range of applications, from clinical diagnosis of different muscular diseases to biomedical engineering, where their use as input for the control of prosthetic devices has become a hot topic of research. The challenge of classifying these signals relies on the accuracy of the proposed algorithm and the possibility of its implementation in hardware. This paper considers the problem of electromyography signal classification, solved with the proposed signal processing and feature extraction stages, with the focus lying on the signal model and time domain characteristics for better classification accuracy. The proposal considers a simple preprocessing technique that produces signals suitable for feature extraction and the Burg reflection coefficients to form learning and classification patterns. These coefficients yield a competitive classification rate compared to the time domain features used. Sometimes, the feature extraction from electromyographic signals has shown that the procedure can omit less useful traits for machine learning models. Using feature selection algorithms provides a higher classification performance with as few traits as possible. The algorithms achieved a high classification rate up to 100% with low pattern dimensionality, with other kinds of uncorrelated attributes for hand movement identification.

## 16. Deep learning in spiking neural networks.
**Keywords:** **'Biological plausibility', 'Deep learning', 'Machine learning', 'Power-efficient architecture', 'Spiking neural network'**

*Journal: Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society* *Publication Date: 2018-Dec-18*

[https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0893-6080(18)30333-2](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0893-6080(18)30333-2){: .btn}

*abstract:* In recent years, deep learning has revolutionized the field of machine learning, for computer vision in particular. In this approach, a deep (multilayer) artificial neural network (ANN) is trained, most often in a supervised manner using backpropagation. Vast amounts of labeled training examples are required, but the resulting classification accuracy is truly impressive, sometimes outperforming humans. Neurons in an ANN are characterized by a single, static, continuous-valued activation. Yet biological neurons use discrete spikes to compute and transmit information, and the spike times, in addition to the spike rates, matter. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are thus more biologically realistic than ANNs, and are arguably the only viable option if one wants to understand how the brain computes at the neuronal description level. The spikes of biological neurons are sparse in time and space, and event-driven. Combined with bio-plausible local learning rules, this makes it easier to build low-power, neuromorphic hardware for SNNs. However, training deep SNNs remains a challenge. Spiking neurons' transfer function is usually non-differentiable, which prevents using backpropagation. Here we review recent supervised and unsupervised methods to train deep SNNs, and compare them in terms of accuracy and computational cost. The emerging picture is that SNNs still lag behind ANNs in terms of accuracy, but the gap is decreasing, and can even vanish on some tasks, while SNNs typically require many fewer operations and are the better candidates to process spatio-temporal data.

## 17. Training recurrent neural networks robust to incomplete data: Application to Alzheimer's disease progression modeling.
**Keywords:** **'Alzheimerâs disease', 'Disease progression modeling', 'Linear discriminant analysis', 'Long short-term memory', 'Magnetic resonance imaging', 'Recurrent neural networks'**

*Journal: Medical image analysis* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-12*

[https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1361-8415(18)30598-X](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1361-8415(18)30598-X){: .btn}

*abstract:* Disease progression modeling (DPM) using longitudinal data is a challenging machine learning task. Existing DPM algorithms neglect temporal dependencies among measurements, make parametric assumptions about biomarker trajectories, do not model multiple biomarkers jointly, and need an alignment of subjects' trajectories. In this paper, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are utilized to address these issues. However, in many cases, longitudinal cohorts contain incomplete data, which hinders the application of standard RNNs and requires a pre-processing step such as imputation of the missing values. Instead, we propose a generalized training rule for the most widely used RNN architecture, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, that can handle both missing predictor and target values. The proposed LSTM algorithm is applied to model the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using six volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers, i.e., volumes of ventricles, hippocampus, whole brain, fusiform, middle temporal gyrus, and entorhinal cortex, and it is compared to standard LSTM networks with data imputation and a parametric, regression-based DPM method. The results show that the proposed algorithm achieves a significantly lower mean absolute error (MAE) than the alternatives with pâ¯<â¯0.05 using Wilcoxon signed rank test in predicting values of almost all of the MRI biomarkers. Moreover, a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier applied to the predicted biomarker values produces a significantly larger area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.90â¯vs. at most 0.84 with pâ¯<â¯0.001 using McNemar's test for clinical diagnosis of AD. Inspection of MAE curves as a function of the amount of missing data reveals that the proposed LSTM algorithm achieves the best performance up until more than 74% missing values. Finally, it is illustrated how the method can successfully be applied to data with varying time intervals. This paper shows that built-in handling of missing values in training an LSTM network benefits the application of RNNs in neurodegenerative disease progression modeling in longitudinal cohorts.

*abstract:* Corticosteroids (CSs) are the most effective asthma therapy, but responses are heterogeneous and systemic CSs lead to long-term side effects. Therefore, improved understanding of the contributing factors for CS responses could enhance precision management. While several factors have been associated with CS responsiveness, no integrated/cluster approach has yet been undertaken to identify differential CS responses.

## 21. Using deep-learning algorithms to derive basic characteristics of social media users: The Brexit campaign as a case study.


*Journal: PloS one* *Publication Date: 2019*

[http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0211013](http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0211013){: .btn}

*abstract:* A recurrent criticism concerning the use of online social media data in political science research is the lack of demographic information about social media users. By employing a face-recognition algorithm to the profile pictures of Facebook users, the paper derives two fundamental demographic characteristics (age and gender) of a sample of Facebook users who interacted with the most relevant British parties in the two weeks before the Brexit referendum of 23 June 2016. The article achieves the goals of (i) testing the precision of the algorithm, (ii) testing its validity, (iii) inferring new evidence on digital mobilisation, and (iv) tracing the path for future developments and application of the algorithm. The findings show that the algorithm is reliable and that it can be fruitfully used in political and social sciences both to confirm the validity of survey data and to obtain information from populations that are generally unavailable within traditional surveys.

## 22. A large scale screening study with a SMR-based BCI: Categorization of BCI users and differences in their SMR activity.


*Journal: PloS one* *Publication Date: 2019*

*abstract:* Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are inefficient for a non-negligible part of the population, estimated around 25%. To understand this phenomenon in Sensorimotor Rhythm (SMR) based BCIs, data from a large-scale screening study conducted on 80 novice participants with the Berlin BCI system and its standard machine-learning approach were investigated. Each participant performed one BCI session with resting state Encephalography, Motor Observation, Motor Execution and Motor Imagery recordings and 128 electrodes. A significant portion of the participants (40%) could not achieve BCI control (feedback performance > 70%). Based on the performance of the calibration and feedback runs, BCI users were stratified in three groups. Analyses directed to detect and elucidate the differences in the SMR activity of these groups were performed. Statistics on reactive frequencies, task prevalence and classification results are reported. Based on their SMR activity, also a systematic list of potential reasons leading to performance drops and thus hints for possible improvements of BCI experimental design are given. The categorization of BCI users has several advantages, allowing researchers 1) to select subjects for further analyses as well as for testing new BCI paradigms or algorithms, 2) to adopt a better subject-dependent training strategy and 3) easier comparisons between different studies.

## 23. Using an optimal set of features with a machine learning-based approach to predict effector proteins for Legionella pneumophila.


*Journal: PloS one* *Publication Date: 2019*

*abstract:* Type IV secretion systems exist in a number of bacterial pathogens and are used to secrete effector proteins directly into host cells in order to change their environment making the environment hospitable for the bacteria. In recent years, several machine learning algorithms have been developed to predict effector proteins, potentially facilitating experimental verification. However, inconsistencies exist between their results. Previously we analysed the disparate sets of predictive features used in these algorithms to determine an optimal set of 370 features for effector prediction. This study focuses on the best way to use these optimal features by designing three machine learning classifiers, comparing our results with those of others, and obtaining de novo results. We chose the pathogen Legionella pneumophila strain Philadelphia-1, a cause of Legionnaires' disease, because it has many validated effector proteins and others have developed machine learning prediction tools for it. While all of our models give good results indicating that our optimal features are quite robust, Model 1, which uses all 370 features with a support vector machine, has slightly better accuracy. Moreover, Model 1 predicted 472 effector proteins that are deemed highly probable to be effectors and include 94% of known effectors. Although the results of our three models agree well with those of other researchers, their models only predicted 126 and 311 candidate effectors.

## 24. (Meta-)stability and Core-Shell Dynamics of Gold Nanoclusters at Finite Temperature.


*Journal: The journal of physical chemistry letters* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-30*

*abstract:* Gold nanoclusters have been the focus of numerous computational studies, but an atomistic understanding of their structural and dynamical properties at finite temperature is far from satisfactory. To address this deficiency, we investigate gold nanoclusters via ab initio molecular dynamics, in a range of sizes where a core-shell morphology is observed. We analyze their structure and dynamics using state-of-the-art techniques, including unsupervised machine-learning nonlinear dimensionality reduction (sketch-map) for describing the similarities and differences among the range of sampled configurations. In the examined temperature range between 300 and 600 K, we find that whereas the gold nanoclusters exhibit continuous structural rearrangement, they are not amorphous. Instead, they clearly show persistent motifs: a cationic core of 1-5 atoms is loosely bound to a shell which typically displays a substructure resulting from the competition between locally spherical versus planar fragments. Besides illuminating the properties of core-shell gold nanoclusters, the present study proposes a set of useful tools for understanding their nature in operando.

*abstract:* The carotenoids lutein (L) and zeaxanthin (Z) accumulate in retinal regions of the eye and have long been shown to benefit visual health. A growing literature suggests cognitive benefits as well, particularly in older adults. The present randomized controlled trial sought to investigate the effects of L and Z on brain function using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). It was hypothesized that L and Z supplementation would (1) improve intra-network integrity of default mode network (DMN) and (2) reduce inter-network connectivity between DMN and other resting state networks. 48 community-dwelling older adults (mean ageâ=â72Â years) were randomly assigned to receive a daily L (10Â mg) and Z (2Â mg) supplement or a placebo for 1Â year. Resting state fMRI data were acquired at baseline and post-intervention. A dictionary learning and sparse coding computational framework, based on machine learning principles, was used to investigate intervention-related changes in functional connectivity. DMN integrity was evaluated by calculating spatial overlap rate with a well-established DMN template provided in the neuroscience literature. Inter-network connectivity was evaluated via time series correlations between DMN and nine other resting state networks. Contrary to expectation, results indicated that L and Z significantly increased rather than decreased inter-network connectivity (Cohen's dâ=â0.89). A significant intra-network effect on DMN integrity was not observed. Rather than restoring what has been described in the available literature as a "youth-like" pattern of intrinsic brain activity, L and Z may facilitate the aging brain's capacity for compensation by enhancing integration between networks that tend to be functionally segregated earlier in the lifespan.

*abstract:* Highly accurate detection of the intracranial hemorrhage without delay is a critical clinical issue for the diagnostic decision and treatment in an emergency room. In the context of a study on diagnostic accuracy, there is a tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity. In order to improve sensitivity while preserving specificity, we propose a cascade deep learning model constructed using two convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and dual fully convolutional networks (FCNs). The cascade CNN model is built for identifying bleeding; hereafter the dual FCN is to detect five different subtypes of intracranial hemorrhage and to delineate their lesions. Using a total of 135,974 CT images including 33,391 images labeled as bleeding, each of CNN/FCN models was trained separately on image data preprocessed by two different settings of window level/width. One is a default window (50/100[level/width]) and the other is a stroke window setting (40/40). By combining them, we obtained a better outcome on both binary classification and segmentation of hemorrhagic lesions compared to a single CNN and FCN model. In determining whether it is bleeding or not, there was around 1% improvement in sensitivity (97.91% [Â±â0.47]) while retaining specificity (98.76% [Â±â0.10]). For delineation of bleeding lesions, we obtained overall segmentation performance at 80.19% in precision and 82.15% in recall which is 3.44% improvement compared to using a single FCN model.

*abstract:* Generalizability of algorithms for binary cancer vs. no cancer classification is unknown for clinically more significant multi-class scenarios where intermediate categories have different risk factors and treatment strategies. We present a system that classifies whole slide images (WSI) of breast biopsies into five diagnostic categories. First, a saliency detector that uses a pipeline of four fully convolutional networks, trained with samples from records of pathologists' screenings, performs multi-scale localization of diagnostically relevant regions of interest in WSI. Then, a convolutional network, trained from consensus-derived reference samples, classifies image patches as non-proliferative or proliferative changes, atypical ductal hyperplasia, ductal carcinoma in situ, and invasive carcinoma. Finally, the saliency and classification maps are fused for pixel-wise labeling and slide-level categorization. Experiments using 240 WSI showed that both saliency detector and classifier networks performed better than competing algorithms, and the five-class slide-level accuracy of 55% was not statistically different from the predictions of 45 pathologists. We also present example visualizations of the learned representations for breast cancer diagnosis.

*abstract:* Due to the biogenesis difference, miRNAs can be divided into canonical microRNAs and mirtrons. Compared to canonical microRNAs, mirtrons are less conserved and hard to be identified. Except stringent annotations based on experiments, many in silico computational methods have be developed to classify miRNAs. Although several machine learning classifiers delivered high classification performance, all the predictors depended heavily on the selection of calculated features. Here, we introduced nucleotide-level convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for pre-miRNAs classification. By using "one-hot" encoding and padding, pre-miRNAs were converted into matrixes with the same shape. The convolution and max-pooling operations can automatically extract features from pre-miRNAs sequences. Evaluation on test dataset showed that our models had a satisfactory performance. Our investigation showed that it was feasible to apply CNNs to extract features from biological sequences. Since there are many hyperparameters can be tuned in CNNs, we believe that the performance of nucleotide-level convolutional neural networks can be greatly improved in the future.

*abstract:* Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease where substantial heterogeneity in clinical presentation urgently requires a better stratification of patients for the development of drug trials and clinical care. In this study we explored stratification through a crowdsourcing approach, the DREAM Prize4Life ALS Stratification Challenge. Using data from >10,000 patients from ALS clinical trials and 1479 patients from community-based patient registers, more than 30 teams developed new approaches for machine learning and clustering, outperforming the best current predictions of disease outcome. We propose a new method to integrate and analyze patient clusters across methods, showing a clear pattern of consistent and clinically relevant sub-groups of patients that also enabled the reliable classification of new patients. Our analyses reveal novel insights in ALS and describe for the first time the potential of a crowdsourcing to uncover hidden patient sub-populations, and to accelerate disease understanding and therapeutic development.

## 33. Identifying outbreaks of Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea virus through animal movements and spatial neighborhoods.

*abstract:* The spread of pathogens in swine populations is in part determined by movements of animals between farms. However, understanding additional characteristics that predict disease outbreaks and uncovering landscape factors related to between-farm spread are crucial steps toward risk mitigation. This study integrates animal movements with environmental risk factors to identify the occurrence of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) outbreaks. Using weekly farm-level incidence data from 332 sow farms, we applied machine-learning algorithms to quantify associations between risk factors and PEDV outbreaks with the ultimate goal of training predictive models and to identify the most important factors associated with PEDV occurrence. Our best algorithm was able to correctly predict whether an outbreak occurred during one-week periods with >80% accuracy. The most important predictors included pig movements into neighboring farms. Other important neighborhood attributes included hog density, environmental and weather factors such as vegetation, wind speed, temperature, and precipitation, and topographical features such as slope. Our neighborhood-based approach allowed us to simultaneously capture disease risks associated with long-distance animal movement as well as local spatial dynamics. The model presented here forms the foundation for near real-time disease mapping and will advance disease surveillance and control for endemic swine pathogens in the United States.

*abstract:* Current approaches to predicting a cardiovascular disease (CVD) event rely on conventional risk factors and cross-sectional data. In this study, we applied machine learning and deep learning models to 10-year CVD event prediction by using longitudinal electronic health record (EHR) and genetic data. Our study cohort included 109, 490 individuals. In the first experiment, we extracted aggregated and longitudinal features from EHR. We applied logistic regression, random forests, gradient boosting trees, convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks with long short-term memory (LSTM) units. In the second experiment, we applied a late-fusion approach to incorporate genetic features. We compared the performance with approaches currently utilized in routine clinical practice - American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association (ACC/AHA) Pooled Cohort Risk Equation. Our results indicated that incorporating longitudinal feature lead to better event prediction. Combining genetic features through a late-fusion approach can further improve CVD prediction, underscoring the importance of integrating relevant genetic data whenever available.

*abstract:* Combining atomistic simulations and machine learning techniques can expedite significantly the materials discovery process. We present an application of such methodological combination for the prediction of the melting transition and amorphous-solid behavior of the NaK alloy at the eutectic concentration. We show that efficient prediction of these properties is possible via machine learning methods trained on the topological local structural properties. The configurations resulting from Monte Carlo annealing of the NaK eutectic alloy are analyzed with topological attributes based on the Voronoi tessellation and using expectation-maximization clustering and Random Forest classification. We show that the Voronoi topological fingerprints make an accurate and fast prediction of the alloy thermal behavior by cataloguing the atomic configurations into three distinct phases: liquid, amorphous solid, and crystalline solid. Melting is found at 230âK by the sharp split of configurations classified as crystalline solid and as liquid. With the proposed metrics, an arrest-motion temperature is identified at 130-140âK through a top down clustering of the atomic configurations catalogued as amorphous solid. This statistical learning paradigm is not restricted to eutectic alloys or thermodynamics, extends the utility of topological attributes in a significant way, and harnesses the discovery of new material properties.

*abstract:* Since 2013, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has hosted an annual influenza season forecasting challenge. The 2015-2016 challenge consisted of weekly probabilistic forecasts of multiple targets, including fourteen models submitted by eleven teams. Forecast skill was evaluated using a modified logarithmic score. We averaged submitted forecasts into a mean ensemble model and compared them against predictions based on historical trends. Forecast skill was highest for seasonal peak intensity and short-term forecasts, while forecast skill for timing of season onset and peak week was generally low. Higher forecast skill was associated with team participation in previous influenza forecasting challenges and utilization of ensemble forecasting techniques. The mean ensemble consistently performed well and outperformed historical trend predictions. CDC and contributing teams will continue to advance influenza forecasting and work to improve the accuracy and reliability of forecasts to facilitate increased incorporation into public health response efforts.

## 37. Diverse motif ensembles specify non-redundant DNA binding activities of AP-1 family members in macrophages.

*abstract:* Mechanisms by which members of the AP-1 family of transcription factors play non-redundant biological roles despite recognizing the same DNA sequence remain poorly understood. To address this question, here we investigate the molecular functions and genome-wide DNA binding patterns of AP-1 family members in primary and immortalized mouse macrophages. ChIP-sequencing shows overlapping and distinct binding profiles for each factor that were remodeled following TLR4 ligation. Development of a machine learning approach that jointly weighs hundreds of DNA recognition elements yields dozens of motifs predicted to drive factor-specific binding profiles. Machine learning-based predictions are confirmed by analysis of the effects of mutations in genetically diverse mice and by loss of function experiments. These findings provide evidence that non-redundant genomic locations of different AP-1 family members in macrophages largely result from collaborative interactions with diverse, locus-specific ensembles of transcription factors and suggest a general mechanism for encoding functional specificities of their common recognition motif.

*abstract:* Because the number of elderly people is predicted to increase quickly in the upcoming years, "aging in place" (which refers to living at home regardless of age and other factors) is becoming an important topic in the area of ambient assisted living. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a human physical activity recognition system based on data collected from smartphone sensors. The proposed approach implies developing a classifier using three sensors available on a smartphone: accelerometer, gyroscope, and gravity sensor. We have chosen to implement our solution on mobile phones because they are ubiquitous and do not require the subjects to carry additional sensors that might impede their activities. For our proposal, we target walking, running, sitting, standing, ascending, and descending stairs. We evaluate the solution against two datasets (an internal one collected by us and an external one) with great effect. Results show good accuracy for recognizing all six activities, with especially good results obtained for walking, running, sitting, and standing. The system is fully implemented on a mobile device as an Android application.

*abstract:* The harsh conditions in Victoria Land, Antarctica have formed a simple ecosystem dominated by microbes that use rocks as shelters to avoid environmental stressors. The area is composed of basement rocks that illustrate the history of complex deformation, thus it is highly valuable not only in perspectives of geology but also in biological aspects. Because this region is inhospitable to higher-level organisms and receives least external influences, it can be an ideal environment to investigate the relationship between rock-inhabiting bacterial communities and environmental factors. In such conditions, inorganics dissolved from minerals can be considered as key factors influencing rock-inhabiting bacterial communities. Thus, the present study attempted to explore rock-inhabiting bacterial communities throughout Victoria Land, to identify environmental parameters that are more influential on bacterial community compositions, and to investigate latitudinal gradients in environmental parameters and rock-inhabiting bacterial communities. The results suggested that (i) rock-inhabiting bacterial communities in Victoria Land predominately consisted of either Actinobacteria or Proteobacteria; (ii) latitudinal gradients in rock-inhabiting bacterial community compositions and some environmental parameters were observed; (iii) latitude, pH, nitrate, and sulfate significantly correlated with the dominant phyla; and (iv) the Classification and Regression Tree (CART) analysis demonstrated that latitude, pH, and sulfate concentrations could explain the dominant phylum with 89% accuracy. These findings can provide important insight into the link between environmental factors and rock-inhabiting bacterial community compositions in conditions with extremely cold temperatures and high levels of radiation, which could also be of interest in astrobiology.

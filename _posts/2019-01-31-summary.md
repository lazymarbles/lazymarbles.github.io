When faced with an uncertain clinical pathosis in the oral cavity, identifying
the color of the mucosal lesion helps to narrow down a differential diagnosis.
Although less common than red and white lesions, yellow lesions encompass a small
group of distinct mucosal pathologic entities. Adipose tissue, lymphoid tissue,
and sebaceous glands are naturally occurring yellow constituents of the oral
cavity and become apparent with associated developmental or neoplastic lesions.
Reactive and inflammatory lesions can create a yellow hue due to purulence,
necrosis, and calcification. Some systemic diseases are known to deposit yellow
bi-products such as amyloid or bilirubin into the oral mucosa of an affected
person, and while not always yellow, unusual entities like verruciform xanthoma
and granular cell tumor fall under the umbrella of yellow lesions given their
occasional propensity to demonstration the color. This chapter aims to explore
the unique group that is yellow lesions presenting in the oral mucosa.

Healthy development in utero relies on the appropriate exchange of nutrients and 
other signalling between the maternal and fetal circulations. Disruption to this 
fine balance is associated with several pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes,
including gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). This is a complex condition
influenced by genetic, environment and potentially epigenetic factors in
association with a range of altered developmental outcomes. A recent study,
published in Clinical Science, explores miRNAs as a molecular mechanism
underpinning the altered function of placental endothelial cells in GDM
pregnancies.

The incidence of chronic kidney diseases (CKDs) is expected to rise, fuelled by
the ever increasing epidemic of Type 2 diabetes. Despite extensive research in
this area, there are currently no effective treatments available to sufficiently 
halt the progression of CKD towards renal failure. This is largely due to ongoing
secondary pathological processes generally elicited by the onset of disease.
Fibrosis, in particular, is a prominent pathological hallmark of many forms of
CKD and considered to be a central contributing factor for the progression of CKD
towards end-stage renal disease. Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) has been
implicated to be a major regulatory cytokine in CKD, especially in fibrosis
development, and reduced TGFβ signalling activity has been previously shown to be
associated with improved renal outcomes in experimental animal studies. A number 
of molecules related to and/or interacting with the TGFβ signalling pathway have 
been identified as potential therapeutic targets. However, due to its pleiotropic
nature, complete inhibition of the TGFβ signalling pathway is likely to lead to
deleterious side effects. Therefore, a better understanding of this pathway and
the molecules modulating this pathway is necessary to develop more efficacious
and therapeutic strategies to combat progression of CKD.

Increased PSA-based screening for prostate cancer has resulted in a growing
number of diagnosed cases. However, around half of these are 'indolent', neither 
metastasizing nor leading to disease specific death. Treating non-progressing
tumours with invasive therapies is currently regarded as unnecessary
over-treatment with patients being considered for conservative regimens, such as 
active surveillance (AS). However, this raises both compliance and protocol
issues. Great clinical benefit could accrue from a biomarker able to predict
long-term patient outcome accurately at the time of biopsy and initial diagnosis.
Here we delineate the translation of a laboratory discovery through to the
precision development of a clinically validated, novel prognostic biomarker assay
(InformMDx™). This centres on determining transcript levels for
phosphodiesterase-4D7 (PDE4D7), an enzyme that breaks down cyclic AMP, a
signalling molecule intimately connected with proliferation and androgen receptor
function. Quantifiable detection of PDE4D7 mRNA transcripts informs on the
longitudinal outcome of post-surgical disease progression. The risk of
post-surgical progression increases steeply for patients with very low 'PDE4D7
scores', while risk decreases markedly for those patients with very high 'PDE4D7 
scores'. Combining clinical risk variables, such as the Gleason or CAPRA (Cancer 
of the Prostate Risk Assessment) score, with the 'PDE4D7 score' further enhances 
the prognostic power of this personalized, precision assessment. Thus the 'PDE4D7
score' has the potential to define, more effectively, appropriate medical
intervention/AS strategies for individual prostate cancer patients.

Proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) is a hepatic enzyme that
regulates the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) receptor and thus
circulating LDL-c levels. With overwhelming evidence now supporting the reduction
in LDL-c to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease, PCSK9 inhibitors represent 
an important therapeutic target, particularly in high-risk populations. Here, we 
summarise and update the science of PCSK9, including its discovery and the
development of various inhibitors, including the now approved monoclonal
antibodies. In addition, we summarise the clinical applications of PCSK9
inhibitors in a range of patient populations, as well as the major randomised
controlled trials investigating their use in coronary prevention.

Trained immunity is a recently described phenomenon whereby innate immune cells
undergo functional reprogramming in response to microbial products, vaccines, or 
other stimuli, leading them to mount a sensitized nonspecific response to
subsequent stimulation. While it is essential for the host response to pathogens,
many diseases are the product of excessive or chronic inflammation.
Atherosclerosis is a disease characterized by chronic low-grade inflammation of
the arterial wall leading to plaque formation, where macrophages are the most
abundant cell regulating plaque progression and stability. Recent studies have
revealed a role for endogenous compounds related to atherosclerosis in the
induction of trained immunity, which can enhance the expression of genes
implicated in atherosclerosis and associated cardiovascular disease. Accelerated 
atherosclerosis remains the principal cause of morbidity and premature mortality 
in patients with diabetes, and the burden of vascular complications is greatly
enhanced by prior periods of inadequate control of blood glucose. Recent findings
suggest that long-term changes in bone marrow myeloid progenitors, similar to
those induced by microbial products or high cholesterol diets in mice, may help
to explain the chronic inflammatory state driving atherosclerosis and
cardiovascular risk that exists for patients with diabetes despite improved
metabolic control. From an immunometabolic perspective, we speculate that changes
supporting the trained macrophage phenotype, such as up-regulation of glycolysis,
indicate that a high glucose environment could enhance the pro-inflammatory
consequences of trained immunity thereby contributing to the accelerated
progression of atherosclerosis in patients with diabetes.

Cancer treatments often reach a refractory period leading to treatment failure
and patients developing disease recurrence. This can be due to tumour cells
escaping the immune response and creating an immunosuppressive microenvironment
enhancing cancer progression. Immunotherapy has become a promising tool for
cancer treatment as it restores the anti-tumour response of the patient's immune 
system. Immune checkpoint inhibitors are the most widely studied immunotherapies 
worldwide and are now approved for multiple cancers. However, chimeric antigen
receptor (CAR)-T cell therapy has also shown promise by targeting T lymphocytes
that are genetically modified ex vivo to express CARs and this is now approved to
treat some haematological cancers. Although immunotherapy has shown successful
treatment outcomes in multiple cancers, some patients do not respond to this
treatment. Therefore, approaches to enhance the efficacy of immunotherapies are
likely to be the key to improve their effectiveness. Therefore, combination
therapies of checkpoint inhibitors +/- chemotherapy are at the forefront of
current research. Furthermore, biomarkers that predict treatment response are now
beginning to emerge. Additionally, utilising nanoparticles as a newly targeted
drug delivery system to enhance CAR-T cell therapy may enhance the efficacy of
the cells when re-infused within the patient. Even if efficacy is enhanced,
severe immune-related adverse events (irAEs) occur that are life-threatening and 
could lead to therapy being stopped. Therefore, predictive biomarkers for
toxicity are also needed to improve both the patient's quality of life and
treatment outcomes. This review will look at the current immunotherapies in
clinical trials and discuss how to enhance their efficacy.

Background/Aims: The aim of this study was to evaluate the sustainability of
sacral neuromodulation (SNM) success in patients with fecal incontinence (FI)
and/or constipation.
Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of a prospective database of patients
who received SNM therapy for FI and/or constipation between 2006 and 2015.
Success rates, complications and reintervention rates were assessed after up to
10 years of follow-up.
Results: Electrodes for test stimulation were implanted in 101 patients, of whom 
79 (78.2%) received permanent stimulation. The mean follow-up was 4.4 ± 3.0
years. At the end of follow-up, 57 patients (72.2%) were still receiving SNM. The
5-year success rate for FI and isolated constipation was 88.2% (95% confidence
interval [CI], 80.1-97.0%) and 31.2% (95% CI, 10.2-95.5%), respectively (P ＜
0.001). In patients with FI, involuntary evacuations per week decreased ＞ 50% in 
76.1% of patients (95% CI, 67.6-86.2%) after 5 years. A lead position at S3 was
associated with an improved outcome (P = 0.04). Battery exchange was necessary in
23 patients (29.1%), with a median battery life of 6.2 years. Reinterventions due
to complications were necessary in 24 patients (30.4%). For these patients, the
5-year success rate was 89.0% (95% CI, 75.3-100.0%) compared to 78.4% (95% CI,
67.2-91.4%) for patients without reintervention.
Conclusions: SNM offers an effective sustainable treatment for FI. For
constipation, lasting success of SNM is limited and is thus not recommended.
Reinterventions are necessary but do not impede treatment success.

Background/Aims: Probiotics are expected to confer benefits on patients with
constipation, but how probiotics act on constipated patients with variable stool 
consistencies remains unclear. We investigated the effect of Lactobacillus casei 
strain Shirota (LcS) on constipation-related symptoms, especially stool
consistency, of constipated patients.
Methods: Constipated patients meeting the Rome III criteria were divided into 3
groups according to the Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS): hard (hard stool [HS],
BSFS ＜ 3), normal (normal stool [NS], ≤ 3 BSFS ≤ 4), and soft (soft stool [SS], 4
＜ BSFS ≤ 5) stools. Subjects in each group consumed a probiotic beverage
containing 10¹⁰ colony-forming units of LcS daily for 28 days.
Results: LcS intervention significantly alleviated constipation-related symptoms 
and increased defecation frequency in all subjects. Four weeks of LcS
supplementation softened the hard stools in HS, hardened the soft stools in SS,
and did not alter the ideal stool consistency in NS. The short-chain fatty acid
(SCFA) concentrations were highest in SS, followed by NS and HS. LcS intervention
increased the stool SCFA levels in HS but reduced or did not alter the levels in 
NS and SS. LcS intervention increased the Pseudobutyrivibrio and Roseburia
abundances in HS and decreased the Pseudobutyrivibrio abundance in SS.
Conclusions: LcS supplementation improved the constipation-related symptoms in
constipated subjects. Differences in baseline stool consistency could result in
different anti-constipation effects of LcS intervention. LcS balanced the stool
consistency-softened the HS and hardened the SS. These effects could be
associated with modulation of the gut microbiota and SCFA production.

Background/Aims: Previous studies from Korea have described chronic intestinal
pseudo-obstruction (CIPO) patients with transition zone (TZ) in the colon. In
this study, we evaluated the pathological characteristics and their association
with long-term outcomes in Korean colonic pseudo-obstruction (CPO) patients with 
TZ.
Methods: We enrolled 39 CPO patients who were refractory to medical treatment and
underwent colectomy between November 1989 and April 2016 (median age at symptoms 
onset: 45 [interquartile range, 29-57] years, males 46.2%). The TZ was defined as
a colonic segment connecting a proximally dilated and distally non-dilated
segment. Detailed pathologic analysis was performed.
Results: Among the 39 patients, 37 (94.9%) presented with TZ and 2 (5.1%) showed 
no definitive TZ. Median ganglion cell density in the TZ adjusted for the colonic
circumference was significantly decreased compared to that in proximal dilated
and distal non-dilated segments in TZ (+) patients (9.2 vs 254.3 and 150.5, P ＜
0.001). Among the TZ (+) patients, 6 showed additional pathologic findings
including eosinophilic ganglionitis (n = 2), ulcers with combined cytomegalovirus
infection (n = 2), diffuse ischemic changes (n = 1), and heterotropic myenteric
plexus (n = 1). During follow-up (median, 61 months), 32 (82.1%) TZ (+) patients 
recovered without symptom recurrence after surgery. The presence of pathological 
features other than hypoganglionosis was an independent predictor of symptom
recurrence after surgery (P = 0.046).
Conclusions: Hypoganglionosis can be identified in the TZ of most Korean CPO
patients. Detection of other pathological features in addition to TZ-associated
hypoganglionosis was associated with poor post-operative outcomes.

Background/Aims: Although symptoms related to the pelvic floor, such as pelvic
organ prolapse (POP) and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), are common in
patients with chronic constipation (CC), its impact is not clear. Our aims were
to investigate the following (1) compare pelvic floor symptom related dysfunction
in irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) and functional constipation
(FC), and (2) symptom correlation with findings on anorectal manometry (ARM) and 
balloon expulsion test.
Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of patients with CC undergoing ARM.
IBS-C and FC were diagnosed by Rome III criteria. Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory
(PFDI-20) was used to measure pelvic floor symptom distress. Constipation
Severity Scale was used to assess constipation severity.
Results: A total of 107 patients underwent ARM (64 FC, 43 IBS-C). The overall
PFDI-20 score in IBS-C was higher compared with FC patients (118.0 vs 79.2, P =
0.001). In those with IBS-C, POP, LUTS, and colorectal symptoms subscales were
all higher compared with FC patients ( P ＜ 0.05 for each). On multivariable
regression, IBS-C ( P = 0.001) and higher constipation severity ( P = 0.001) were
both independently associated with higher PFDI scores. ARM parameters and
abnormal balloon expulsion test did not correlate with PFDI scores.
Conclusions: Compared with FC patients, those with IBS-C have significantly
higher distress from pelvic floor specific symptoms including POP and LUTS.
Higher abdominal pain among IBS-C patients did not entirely explain these
findings. A diagnosis of IBS-C and higher constipation severity correlated with
PFDI-20 scores, but dyssynergia did not.

Background/Aims: Functional constipation (FC) is aa frequent functional
gastrointestinal disorder, diagnosed according to the Rome criteria. In this
study, we compared Rome III and Rome IV criteria for the diagnosis of FC, and
determined the prevalence of FC according to these criteria.
Methods: Consecutive children between infancy and 17 years old were recruited for
the study, excluding those with a known organic gastrointestinal disease. A
prospective longitudinal design has beenused. For the diagnosis of FC,
questionnaires on Pediatric Gastrointestinal Symptoms (QPGS) based on the Rome
III and Rome IV criteria (QPGS-RIII and QPGS-RIV) were used. The agreement
between these 2 questionnaires was measured by Cohen's kappa coefficient.
Results: Two hundred fourteen children (mean age, 77.4 ± 59.5 months; 103 males) 
were screened. There was no statistically significant difference in the
prevalence of FC evaluated using the QPGS-Rome IV vs the QPGS-Rome III in the
overall sample (39/214 [18.2%] vs 37/214 [17.3.0%]; P = 0.831) as well as in any 
of the groups. The Cohen's kappa test showed a good agreement between the 2
criteria (κ = 0.65; 95% CI, 0.51 to 0.78).
Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that the new Rome IV criteria have a good
agreement with the Rome III criteria for the diagnosis of FC, without an increase
in the number of potential diagnoses, despite the reduction in the duration of
the symptoms. This conclusion is important in the management of childhood FC,
since a late diagnosis negatively affects the prognosis.

Background/Aims: The abdominal pain-related functional gastrointestinal disorders
(AP-FGIDs) affect a significant proportion of the pediatric population and
consist 1 of the most frequent causes for seeking medical advice. In this study, 
we aimed to assess the relation of dietary habits with the likelihood of
AP-FGIDs.
Methods: This was a school-based, cross-sectional study approved by the Greek
Government authorities, after obtaining informed consent by the legal
representatives of the children. Diagnoses of AP-FGIDs were based on the Greek
official translation of the Rome III questionnaire. Demographic, socioeconomic
and dietary data were collected through self-reporting or parent-reporting
questionnaires. Associations between the probability of AP-FGIDs and dietary
practices were assessed after adjusting for known confounders through a multiple 
logistic regression analysis.
Results: A total of 1365 children (147 AP-FGIDs and 1218 controls, 52.4% females,
mean age: 12.8 ± 2.8 years) were included. Multiple regression analysis
identified the following statistically significant confounders: victimization,
the presence of a person with a severe health problem at home, female sex,
engaging in limited physical exercise, and living in a single adult family.
Subsequently, logistic regression, adjusted for the abovementioned confounders,
showed that reduced fish and increased junk food consumption were related to a
higher likelihood of AP-FGIDs.
Conclusions: Children with AP-FGIDs report excessive junk-food and reduced fish
intake compared to controls. Further studies are needed in order to clarify the
nature of this observation.

Background/Aims: High-resolution methods have advanced esophageal and anorectal
manometry interpretation but are incompletely established for intestinal
manometry. We characterized normal fasting duodeno-jejunal manometry parameters
not measurable by standard techniques using clustered closely-spaced recordings.
Methods: Ten fasting recordings were performed in 8 healthy controls using
catheters with 3-4 gastrointestinal manometry clusters with 1-2 cm channel
spacing. Migrating motor complex phase III characteristics were quantified.
Spatial-temporal contour plots measured propagation direction and velocity of
individual contractions. Coupling was defined by pressure peak continuity within 
clusters.
Results: Twenty-three phase III complexes (11 antral, 12 intestinal origin) with 
157 (95% CI, 104-211) minute periodicities, 6.99 (6.25-7.74) minute durations,
10.92 (10.68-11.16) cycle/minute frequencies, 73.6 (67.7-79.5) mmHg maximal
amplitudes, and 4.20 (3.18-5.22) cm/minute propagation velocities were recorded. 
Coupling of individual contractions was 39.1% (32.1-46.1); 63.0% (54.4-71.6) of
contractions were antegrade and 32.8% (24.1-41.5) were retrograde. Individual
phase III contractions propagated > 35 fold faster (2.48 cm/sec; 95% CI,
2.25-2.71) than complexes themselves. Phase III complexes beyond the proximal
jejunum were longer in duration (P = 0.025) and had poorer contractile coupling
(P = 0.025) than proximal complexes. Coupling was greater with 1 cm channel
spacing vs 2 cm (P ＜ 0.001).
Conclusions: Intestinal manometry using clustered closely-spaced pressure ports
characterizes novel antegrade and retrograde propagation and coupling properties 
which degrade in more distal jejunal segments. Coupling is greater with more
closely-spaced recordings. Applying similar methods to dysmotility syndromes will
define the relevance of these methods.

Background/Aims: The Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease Questionnaire (GerdQ) has
been developed and validated as a tool for the diagnosis of gastroesophageal
reflux disease (GERD) in patients with gastrointestinal symptoms. However, the
GerdQ and the cutoff value for determining GERD has not been validated in Korea.
Methods: Patients with symptoms suggestive of GERD were consecutively recruited. 
The Korean version of GerdQ was developed through a forward-backward translation 
process according to the cross-cultural adaptation method. Endoscopically
documented esophagitis, abnormal results on 24-hour ambulatory pH recording with 
symptom association monitoring, or response to proton pump inhibitor treatment
were used as diagnostic references for GERD. The reproducibility and test
characteristics of the Korean version of GerdQ were assessed.
Results: A total of 149 patients with a median age of 55 years were analyzed. The
intra-class correlation coefficient of 2 subsequently measured GerdQ scores was
0.651 (95% CI, 0.518-0.748). The cutoff value of 8 was found to have the highest 
sensitivity (64.9%; 95% CI, 56.2-73.7) and specificity (71.4%; 95% CI, 56.5-86.4)
for the diagnosis of GERD. The questionnaire had a high positive predictive value
(88.1%; 95% CI, 81.2-95.0), but a low negative predictive value (38.5%; 95% CI,
26.2-50.3) for GERD. Any symptom improvement on proton pump inhibitor treatment
showed a sensitivity of 93.0% (95% CI, 88.3-97.7) and a specificity of 48.6% (95%
CI, 32.0-65.1) for GERD.
Conclusion: The Korean version of GerdQ is a useful complementary tool in the
diagnosis of GERD.

Background/Aims: The effect of dietary micronutrients on non-erosive reflux
disease (NERD) and reflux esophagitis is unclear. We aim to evaluate the
gender-specific effect of micronutrient on erosive esophagitis and NERD.
Methods: A total of 11 690 participants underwent endoscopy and completed 3-day
recordings for dietary intake and questionnaires for reflux symptoms from 2004 to
2008. To evaluate the effect of dietary micronutrients on NERD or erosive
esophagitis, adjusted regression analysis with odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence
interval (CI) was used. In addition, we performed gender-specific analysis.
Results: Prevalence of NERD and erosive esophagitis was 6.8% and 11.2% in men and
9.1% and 2.4% in women. In adjusted analysis, high intake of vitamin A (OR, 0.78;
95% CI, 0.64-0.96), retinol (OR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.59-0.90), vitamin B2 (OR, 0.68; 
95% CI, 0.54-0.87), vitamin B6 (OR, 0.75; 95% CI, 0.58-0.96), folic acid (OR,
0.77; 95% CI, 0.62-0.96), calcium (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.53-0.82), and iron (OR,
0.68; 95% CI, 0.53-0.87) had an inverse association with NERD. However, erosive
esophagitis has no relationship with micronutrients except vitamin C (OR, 0.78;
95% CI, 0.62-0.98). High dietary intake of calcium reduced the risk of NERD in
men and high dietary intake of many micronutrients reduced NERD in women.
Conclusions: While many dietary micronutrients reduced NERD, they had no effect
on erosive esophagitis. The effect of micronutrient on NERD was more prominent in
women than men.

Background/Aims: Esophagogastric junction outflow obstruction (EGJOO) is a
diagnostically heterogeneous group with variable clinical relevance. We studied
whether evaluation of bolus transit by multichannel intraluminal impedance (MII) 
is useful for discriminating clinically relevant EGJOO.
Methods: A total 169 patients diagnosed as having EGJOO between June 2011 and
February 2018 were analyzed. All the patients received a combined MII and
high-resolution manometry (CMII-HRM). MII was reported as having abnormal liquid 
bolus transit (LBT) if ＜ 80% of swallows had complete bolus transit. EGJOO was
defined as a median integrated relaxation pressure of ＞ 20 mmHg and when the
criteria for achalasia were not met. Patients who progress to achalasia, show
significant passage disturbance, or require pneumatic dilatation were defined as 
having a clinically relevant EGJOO.
Results: Among the patients with EGJOO (n = 169), the clinically relevant group
(n = 10) is more likely to have dysphagia (100% vs 25.2%, P ＜ 0.001),
compartmentalized pressurization (CP; 90.0% vs 22.0%, P ＜ 0.001), and abnormal
LBT (100% vs 66.7%, P = 0.032) compared to the non-relevant group (n = 159). The 
combination of dysphagia, CP, and abnormal LBT showed the best predictive power
for clinically relevant EGJOO (sensitivity 90%, specificity 92.5%, positive
predictive value 42.9%, negative predictive value 99.3%, positive likelihood
ratio 11.9, and negative likelihood ratio 0.1). When CMII-HRM was used, an
additional 8.3% of clinically relevant EGJOO cases were identified as compared
with HRM alone.
Conclusion: Clinically relevant EGJOO can be predicted using CMII-HRM.

Background/Aims: The role of esophageal motility in determining gastroesophageal 
reflux disease (GERD) severity has not been completely evaluated. A few studies
have investigated high-resolution manometry (HRM) patterns during solid swallows.
The present study evaluates the HRM patterns of non-erosive reflux disease (NERD)
patients during both liquid and solid swallows and their correlation with the
severity of GERD.
Methods: In 23 NERD patients and 15 healthy volunteers (HVs) HRM was performed
during a standard solid meal in a seated position, followed by 24-hour
impedance-pH monitoring.
Results: Of the 31 patients, 10 showed a pathological acid exposure time (AET;
NERD patients), 13 a normal pH profile with positive symptom association
probability (SAP; reflux hypersensitivity patients), and 8 normal AET and SAP
(functional heartburn patients). Mean distal contractile integral and distal
latency values, in all patient groups and HVs, were significantly higher during
solid swallows. In the group of 10 NERD patients, the number of large breaks of
the esophageal peristalsis was 16 out of 100 liquid swallows (16%) and 31 out of 
171 solid swallows (18%). Fourteen out of 100 liquid swallows (14%) and 25 out of
171 solid swallows (15%) resulted ineffective. Mean reflux clearing time at
multichannel intraluminal impedance-pH was 17.6 ± 3.7 seconds. NERD patients
presented, during solid swallows, a significantly higher proportion of large
peristaltic breaks and of ineffective swallows than reflux hypersensitivity and
functional heartburn patients.
Conclusion: HRM during solid swallows reveals motor abnormalities, undetected
during liquid swallows, which might be involved in delaying reflux and acid
clearance in patients with GERD.

Background/Aims: The distribution and esophageal motor characteristics of Chinese
patients with esophageal dysphagia who exhibit no structural abnormalities on
esophagogastroduodenoscopy remain unclear. Our aim is to assess the esophageal
motor patterns using high-resolution manometry (HRM) and classify them according 
to the Chicago classification version 3.0 (CC v3.0). Furthermore, we compared the
CC v3.0 and the previous version 2.0 (CC v2.0) for diagnosis of motor disorders.
Methods: Two hundred thirty-six (mean age 48.4 ± 12.2 years, 61.9% female)
patients with esophageal dysphagia were included for analysis of motor function
using HRM. All participants were administered a questionnaire to determine
Eckardt scores before HRM.
Results: According to the CC v3.0, 57 (24.2%) patients showed evidence of
esophagogastric junction outflow obstruction and were classified as Group 1.
Eighteen (7.6%) patients with major disorders of peristalsis were classified as
Group 2. Minor disorders of peristalsis (Group 3) were much more frequent (129
[54.7%] patients). Thirty-two (13.6%) patients had normal esophageal manometry
were classified as Group 4. All patients with abnormal pH or pH impedance
monitoring (n = 44) had minor motor disorders (ineffective esophageal motility
[IEM] = 34, fragmented peristalsis = 10). Based on motor category, the Eckardt
score was 4.7 ± 0.1 in Group 1, 4.5 ± 0.3 in Group 2, 3.5 ± 0.1 in Group 3, and
3.9 ± 0.1 in Group 4.
Conclusions: IEM was the most common esophageal motor disorder in patients with
esophageal dysphagia who showed no structural abnormality on endoscopy. While a
high Eckardt score suggests outflow obstruction or a major motor disorder, a low 
score suggests IEM.

Brain-Gut-Microbiota Axis in Alzheimer's Disease.

Kowalski K(1), Mulak A(1).

Author information:

Poland.

Disturbances along the brain-gut-microbiota axis may significantly contribute to 
the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the 
most frequent cause of dementia characterized by a progressive decline in
cognitive function associated with the formation of amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and
neurofibrillary tangles. Alterations in the gut microbiota composition induce
increased permeability of the gut barrier and immune activation leading to
systemic inflammation, which in turn may impair the blood-brain barrier and
promote neuroinflammation, neural injury, and ultimately neurodegeneration.
Recently, Aβ has also been recognized as an antimicrobial peptide participating
in the innate immune response. However, in the dysregulated state, Aβ may reveal 
harmful properties. Importantly, bacterial amyloids through molecular mimicry may
elicit cross-seeding of misfolding and induce microglial priming. The Aβ seeding 
and propagation may occur at different levels of the brain-gut-microbiota axis.
The potential mechanisms of amyloid spreading include neuron-to-neuron or distal 
neuron spreading, direct blood-brain barrier crossing or via other cells as
astrocytes, fibroblasts, microglia, and immune system cells. A growing body of
experimental and clinical data confirms a key role of gut dysbiosis and gut
microbiota-host interactions in neurodegeneration. The convergence of gut-derived
inflammatory response together with aging and poor diet in the elderly contribute
to the pathogenesis of AD. Modification of the gut microbiota composition by
food-based therapy or by probiotic supplementation may create new preventive and 
therapeutic options in AD.

Mebendazole (MBZ), a microtubule depolymerizing drug commonly used for the
treatment of helminthic infections, has recently been noted as a repositioning
candidate for angiogenesis inhibition and cancer therapy. However, the definite
anti-angiogenic mechanism of MBZ remains unclear. In this study, we explored the 
inhibitory mechanism of MBZ in endothelial cells (ECs) and developed a novel
strategy to improve its anti-angiogenic therapy. Treatment of ECs with MBZ led to
inhibition of EC proliferation in a dose-dependent manner in several culture
conditions in the presence of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), basic
fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) or FBS, without selectivity of growth factors,
although MBZ is known to inhibit VEGF receptor 2 kinase. Furthermore, MBZ
inhibited EC migration and tube formation induced by either VEGF or bFGF.
However, unexpectedly, treatment of MBZ did not affect FAK and ERK1/2
phosphorylation induced by these factors. Treatment with MBZ induced shrinking of
ECs and caused G2-M arrest and apoptosis with an increased Sub-G1 fraction. In
addition, increased levels of nuclear fragmentation, p53 expression, and active
form of caspase 3 were observed. The marked induction of autophagy by MBZ was
also noted. Interestingly, inhibition of autophagy through knocking down of
Beclin1 or ATG5/7, or treatment with autophagy inhibitors such as 3-methyladenine
and chloroquine resulted in marked enhancement of anti-proliferative and
pro-apoptotic effects of MBZ in ECs. Consequently, we suggest that MBZ induces
autophagy in ECs and that protective autophagy can be a novel target for
enhancing the anti-angiogenic efficacy of MBZ in cancer treatment.

Substances that can be used as photosensitizers for cardiac tissue are very
helpful in modeling various excitation patterns in a cardiac tissue culture and
may have prospective use in the temporary and permanent ablation of unwanted
excitation sources in the heart.The aim of the present work is to study the
effect of stilbene derivative c-TAB (2- {4- [(E) -2- (4-ethoxyphenyl) vinyl]
phenoxy} ethyl) trimethylammonium bromide) on the cardiomyocyte layers and
voltage-gated ion channels in cardiac cells. C-TAB is a structural analog to
AzoTAB, reported previously as a photoswitch for cardiac and neural cells, in
which the azobenzene moiety is replaced by a stilbene grouping. Such a
replacement makes c-TAB less toxic to living cells. c-TAB has been shown to
successfully inhibit excitation in cardiac cells in both trans- and cis- forms.
The excitation inhibition of cardiac cells under c-TAB is reversible and can be
overturned easily by washing out the c-TAB; however, not by light illumination.
The irradiation of cardiac cells with near-UV, when the trans- form of c-TAB is
applied, changes reversible inhibition to a permanent one that cannot be
overturned by a washout.

The present study aimed to unravel the molecular basis underlying PAX3
down-regulation, known to be involved in pre-eclampsia (PE) occurrence and
development. Data obtained from databases suggested that Pax3 methylation levels 
in the promoter region are high in the placentas of PE patients. However, the
expression of methylation-adjusting enzymes, including DNMT1, LSD1, and EZH2, did
not change. Since lncRNAs enhance the function of methylation-related enzymes
independently of expression, we selected three lncRNAs, RP11-269F21.2,
DIAPH2-AS1, and RP11-445K13.2, predicted to interact with methylation-adjusting
enzymes. Two transcription factors, HOXD8 and Lhx3, predicted to regulate the
expression of lncRNAs, were also selected. Using RNA interference technology,
HOXD8 and Lhx3 were found to positively regulate DIAPH2-AS1 and RP11-445K13.2 in 
HTR-8/SVneo cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays determined that
DIAPH2-AS1 recruited LSD1 to histone 3, increasing DNMT1 stability at H3. The
HOXD8/DIAPH2-AS1 network regulated HTR-8/SVneo cell function under hypoxia by
epigenetically regulating PAX3. This regulatory network may thus be responsible
for PAX3 down-regulation in the placentas of PE patients.

The morphology and histology changes in the medial meniscus after posterior
cruciate ligament (PCL) rupture are poorly understood. Forty-eight rabbits were
divided into matched mode pairs; each rabbit had an experimental side, in which
the PCL was transacted, and a control side. At the 4, 8, 16 and 24 weeks after
the PCL transection, each of the 12 rabbits was killed. Histology was performed
to detect the expression of the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases-1
(TIMP-1), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 and MMP-13 in the medial meniscus. We 
found that medial meniscus displayed significant degenerative characteristics in 
morphology. The histological evaluation of the degeneration found that the
expression levels of TIMP-1, MMP-1 and MMP-13 in the medial meniscus were higher 
in the experiment side than those in the control side (P<0.05). The expression of
both TIMP-1 and MMP-13 was initially elevated and then decreased. The MMP-1
expression reached its peak swiftly and then maintained a relatively high level. 
There were clear time-dependent degenerative changes in the histology of the
medial meniscus after PCL rupture. The high expression of TIMP-1, MMP-1 and
MMP-13 in the cartilage may be responsible for the degeneration, and PCL rupture 
may trigger meniscus degradation and ultimately osteoarthritis.

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in a deadly disease that can be
brought on by endotoxins such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS). ARDS is characterized 
by vascular permeability, a severe inflammatory response, lung leukocyte
infiltration, and resultant lung edema. Polymerase δ-interacting protein 2
(Poldip2) is a novel regulator of blood-brain barrier permeability; however, its 
role in regulating lung permeability and vascular inflammation is unknown. Here, 
the role of Poldip2 in regulating vascular permeability and inflammation in a
mouse model of ARDS was assessed. Heterozygous deletion of Poldip2 was found to
reduce LPS-induced mortality within 20 h, lung inflammatory signaling, and
leukocyte infiltration. Moreover, reduced Poldip2-suppressed LP-induced vascular 
cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 induction, leukocyte recruitment, and
mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in vitro These data
indicate that Poldip2 is an important regulator of the debilitating consequences 
of ARDS, potentially through the regulation of mitochondrial ROS-induced
inflammatory signaling. Consequently, inhibition of Poldip2 may be a viable
option for therapeutic discovery moving forward.

Kidney fibrosis is the common pathophysiological mechanism in end-stage renal
disease characterized by excessive accumulation of myofibroblast-derived
extracellular matrix. Natriuretic peptides have been demonstrated to have cyclic 
guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-dependent anti-fibrotic properties likely due to
interference with pro-fibrotic tissue growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling. However,
in vivo, natriuretic peptides are rapidly degraded by neutral endopeptidases
(NEP). In a unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) mouse model for kidney fibrosis
we assessed the anti-fibrotic effects of SOL1, an orally active compound that
inhibits NEP and endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE). Mice (n=10 per group)
subjected to UUO were treated for 1 week with either solvent, NEP-/ECE-inhibitor 
SOL1 (two doses), reference NEP-inhibitor candoxatril or the angiotensin II
receptor type 1 (AT1)-antagonist losartan. While NEP-inhibitors had no
significant effect on blood pressure, they did increase urinary cGMP levels as
well as endothelin-1 (ET-1) levels. Immunohistochemical staining revealed a
marked decrease in renal collagen (∼55% reduction, P<0.05) and α-smooth muscle
actin (α-SMA; ∼40% reduction, P<0.05). Moreover, the number of α-SMA positive
cells in the kidneys of SOL1-treated groups inversely correlated with cGMP levels
consistent with a NEP-dependent anti-fibrotic effect. To dissect the molecular
mechanisms associated with the anti-fibrotic effects of NEP inhibition, we
performed a 'deep serial analysis of gene expression (Deep SAGE)' transcriptome
and targeted metabolomics analysis of total kidneys of all treatment groups.
Pathway analyses linked increased cGMP and ET-1 levels with decreased nuclear
receptor signaling (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor [PPAR] and liver X
receptor/retinoid X receptor [LXR/RXR] signaling) and actin cytoskeleton
organization. Taken together, although our transcriptome and metabolome data
indicate metabolic dysregulation, our data support the therapeutic potential of
NEP inhibition in the treatment of kidney fibrosis via cGMP elevation and reduced
myofibroblast formation.

Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease predominantly
affecting women and often leading to lupus nephritis and kidney damage.
Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has been implicated in several forms of kidney 
disease, but whether ER stress contributes to renal injury in SLE is unknown. To 
investigate this, a small molecule chaperone, sodium 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA),
was administered to the New Zealand Black x New Zealand White F1 hybrid (NZBWF1) 
mouse model of SLE. In a prevention study, treatment with 4-PBA from 20 weeks of 
age (prior to the development of renal injury) delayed the onset of albuminuria
and significantly reduced additional indices of renal injury compared with
vehicle-treated NZBWF1 mice at 36 weeks of age, including collagen deposition,
tubular casts, renal cell apoptosis, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) concentration.
To test whether ER stress contributes to the progression of renal injury once
albuminuria has developed, mice were monitored for the onset of albuminuria (3+
or ≥300 mg/dl by dipstick measurement of 24-h urine sample) and once established,
were either killed (onset group), or underwent 4-PBA or vehicle treatment for 4
weeks. Treatment with 4-PBA blocked the worsening of glomerular injury, reduced
the number of dilated or cast-filled tubules, and reduced the number of apoptotic
cells compared with vehicle-treated mice. BUN and left ventricle to bodyweight
ratio (LV:BW) were also reduced by 4-PBA treatment. Renal expression of the
endogenous chaperones, protein disulphide isomerase (PDI), and 78 kDa
glucose-regulated protein (GRP78, also known as binding Ig protein (BiP)), were
increased in 4-PBA-treated mice. Together, these results suggest a therapeutic
potential for agents like 4-PBA in combating renal injury in SLE.

Several studies have explored the association between matrix Gla protein (MGP)
gene polymorphism and knee osteoarthritis (OA) risk; however, they obtained
conflicting findings. The present study aims to explore the association of MGP
gene polymorphism and OA risk in a Chinese Han population. A total of 256
patients with radiographic knee OA and 327 control subjects were recruited in
this case-control study. The genotypes of MGP gene rs1800802 polymorphism was
determined by standard PCR and restriction fragment length polymorphism
(PCR-RLFP). In this case-control study, we observed that MGP gene rs1800802
polymorphism increased the risk of knee OA. Subgroup analyses also found that
rs1800802 polymorphism was related to the elevated risk for knee OA among the
female, smoker, drinker, and body mass index (BMI) ≥25 kg/m2 groups. In
conclusion, this study shows that MGP gene rs1800802 polymorphism is associated
with increased risk for knee OA in Chinese Han population and the rs1800802
polymorphism may be a diagnostic marker of radiographic knee OA.

Objective: Genetic factors are involved in the occurrence, development, and
progression of essential hypertension (EH). To study the association between
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the rs6435156 and rs1048829 loci of the
bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 (BMPR2) gene, the rs121909287 and
rs121909284 loci of the activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ACVRL1) gene, and the
rs397514716 and rs121918359 loci of the mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 9
(SMAD9) gene with the risk of EH in the Chinese Han population. Materials and
methods : A total of 460 EH patients and 460 healthy controls were recruited for 
the study. Genomic DNA of white blood cells was extracted, and the genotypes were
analyzed by Sanger sequencing after polymerase chain reaction amplification.
Multi-factor dimensionality reduction (MDR) was used to analyze the effect of
gene-environment interactions on EH risk. Results: The risk of EH increased in
the BMPR2 gene rs6435156 locus dominant model (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.572, 
95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.385-1.765, P<0.001) and recessive model (adjusted
OR = 1.926, 95% CI: 1.693-2.067, P<0.001). The risk of EH increased in the
rs1048829 recessive model (adjusted OR = 1.444, 95% CI: 1.142-1.696, P=0.003).
The risk of EH increased in the recessive model of the ACVRL1 gene rs121909287
locus (adjusted OR = 1.403, 95% CI: 1.101-1.660, P=0.008). The risk of EH
increased in the SMAD9 gene rs397514716 locus dominant model (adjusted OR =
1.370, 95% CI: 1.183-1.559, P<0.001) and recessive model (adjusted OR = 1.803,
95% CI: 1.470-1.983, P<0.001). The CG haplotype of the rs6435156 and rs1048829
loci of the BMPR2 gene, the CC haplotype of the ACVRL1 gene rs121909287 and
rs121909284 loci, and the CC haplotype of the rs397514716 and rs121918359 loci of
the SMAD9 gene were factors that protect against EH, whereas the TT haplotype of 
the rs6435156 and rs1048829 loci in the BMPR2 gene was a risk factor for EH. MDR 
analysis showed that the BMPR2 gene rs6435156 locus TT genotype carriers, the
SMAD9 gene rs397514716 locus TT genotype carriers, and alcohol drinkers had the
highest EH risk (OR = 4.523, 95% CI: 2.235-6.871, P<0.001). Conclusion: The SNPs 
of the rs6435156 and rs1048829 locus in the BMPR2 gene, the rs121909287 loci in
the ACVRL1 gene, and the rs397514716 locus in the SMAD9 gene were associated with
a risk of EH in Han Chinese.

We observed inconsistent conclusions regarding the genetic role of glutathione
S-transferase gene polymorphisms, including glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1),
glutathione S-transferase T1 (GSTT1) present/null, and glutathione S-transferase 
pi (GSTP1) Ile105Val polymorphisms, in the susceptibility to nasal or colorectal 
polyposis (NP or CP). Thus, we aimed to perform a meta-analysis to
comprehensively evaluate this association by applying Stata/SE software. After
the heterogeneity assumption, Mantel-Haenszel statistics were used to obtain the 
odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence interval (95% CI) and P-value of the association 
test (PA ). We obtained a total of 235 articles by searching online databases.
After screening, ten eligible case-control studies were finally enrolled in our
meta-analysis. For the meta-analysis of the GSTT1 gene under present versus null,
we observed a decreased risk of NP [OR = 0.65; PA =0.018], but not CP. In
addition, we did not detect any evident association between the GSTM1
present/null polymorphism and NP or CP risk. For the meta-analysis of the GSTP1
Ile105Val polymorphism, compared with controls, an increased risk of NP cases was
detected under the models of Val versus Ile (OR = 1.36; PA =0.027), Ile/Val
versus Ile/Ile (OR = 1.70; PA =0.011) and Ile/Val+Val/Val versus Ile/Ile (OR =
1.65; PA =0.010). In conclusion, the null genotype of the GSTT1 polymorphism may 
be linked to an increased susceptibility to NP, whereas the Ile/Val genotype of
the GSTP1 Ile105Val polymorphism may be associated with a decreased risk of NP.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide,
characterized by uncontrolled proliferation and metastasis of lung cancer cells. 
Tumor angiogenesis plays a key role in proliferation and metastasis in cancers,
and is an essential component in microenvironment. It has been reported that long
non-coding RNA FBXL19-AS1 plays an oncogenic role in colorectal cancer. However, 
the molecular mechanism of FBXL19-AS1 in lung cancer has not been fully
elucidated. In the present study, we found that FBXL19-AS1 expression was
up-regulated in lung cancer tissues and cell lines. FBXL19-AS1 knockdown
inhibited cell proliferation, migration, invasion, and angiogenesis in lung
cancer cells. Molecular mechanism exploration uncovered that FBXL19-AS1 acted as 
a molecular sponge of miR-431-5p and that RAF1 was a downstream target of
miR-431-5p in lung cancer. Moreover, there was a negative association between
miR-431-5p expression and FBXL19-AS1 or RAF1 expression in tumor tissues. Through
rescue experiments, we discovered that overexpression of RAF1 partially rescued
FBXL19-AS1 knockdown-mediated inhibition of angiogenesis and progression in lung 
cancer. Together, these results indicated that FBXL19-AS1 was involved in
progression and angiogenesis in lung cancer by targeting miR-431-5p/RAF1 axis,
which provided a new insight into the therapeutic strategies of lung cancer.

Wilms tumor is the most common renal malignancy that occurs in children. TP53
gene is considered as a tumor-suppressing gene through controlling cell growth.
TP53 gene rs1042522 C>G (Arg72Pro) polymorphism is widely investigated in various
types of cancers. However, it is not established if TP53 rs1042522 C>G
polymorphism is a candidate variant for Wilms tumor risk. The aim of the study
was to determine whether TP53 rs1042522 C>G polymorphism is responsible for the
risk of Wilms tumor in Chinese children. All subjects (355 cases and 1070
controls) from four centers of China were genotyped for rs1042522 C>G
polymorphism. The effect of rs1042522 C>G polymorphism on Wilms tumor prevalence 
was analyzed using logistic regression models. We failed to detect a significant 
relationship between rs1042522 C>G polymorphism and Wilms tumor risk. Further
stratification analysis also could not detect a significant relationship. We
conclude that TP53 rs1042522 C>G polymorphism might not have enough impact on the
risk of Wilms tumor. More validation study with larger sample size will be
required to better define the role of TP53 rs1042522 C>G polymorphism in Wilms
tumor risk.

The large-scale identification of putative alternative promoters study shows more
than 52% of human genes are regulated by alternative promoters. The human
myc-associated zinc finger protein (SAF/MAZ) gene have SAF-1 and SAF-3 variants
transcripted from two transcription start sites (TSSs). By using SAF/MAZ promoter
as a model, we set up an approach to probe how the alternative promoters are
regulated in real time. We have constructed the bichromatic fluorescent reporter 
driven by SAF/MAZ 5'-proximal promoter plasmids from which transactivation status
of SAF-1 and SAF-3 alternative promoter could be monitored by EGFP and DsRed
expression respectively. The results showed that the SAF-3 expression is
regulated by alternative promoters. When the bichromatic fluorescent reporter was
driven by -1692/+277 or -1401/+277 SAF/MAZ promoter the dominant expression of
SAF-3 would be observed in comparison with SAF-1 expression. We also identified
that Elk-1 is an inhibitory transcription factor for SAF-3 expression. The
temporal diversity of SAF-1 and SAF-3 expressions can be observed via bichromatic
fluorescent reporters. These imply that the bichromatic fluorescent reporter
driven by alternative promoter construct might be a useful tool for decoding the 
temporal regulatory repertoire of alternative promoter in human genes.

BACKGROUND AND AIM: The aim of the present study sought to determine the
protective function of Shenqi Fuzheng Injection (SFI) in cholestatic liver
injury.
METHODS: Cholestatic liver injury was induced in a 7-day bile duct-ligated (BDL) 
rat model. Rats were divided into three groups that were comprised of: (1) Sham; 
(2) BDL model; and (3) SFI treatment. The sham and BDL groups were treated with
an appropriate volume of 0.9% sodium chloride as the vehicle, and the SFI group
was administered SFI at a dose of 20 ml/kg/day, via tail vein injection.
RESULTS: SFI significantly (all at P<0.01) decreased the levels of serum
aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase as compared with the BDL 
group, which was associated with reduced severity of inflammatory cell
infiltration and hepatic damage. Moreover, SFI significantly decreased the levels
of hepatic interleukin-6 (P<0.01), tumor necrosis factor-α (P=0.041), and
malondialdehyde (P=0.026), and significantly increased the levels of total
superoxide dismutase (P<0.01), and the GSH/GSSG ratio (P=0.041) in the liver.
Western blot analysis showed that SFI increased PPAR-γ expression; however, SFI
treatment decreased cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression and the phosphorylation
of NF-κBp65.
CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrated that SFI attenuated both inflammation and
oxidative stress, and disrupted cholestatic liver injury. The involved mechanism 
was dependent, at least in part, on regulating PPAR-γ, COX-2, and NF-κBp65
expression.

Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is the most common cyanotic form of congenital heart
defects (CHDs). The right ventricular hypertrophy is associated with the survival
rate of patients with repaired TOF. However, very little is known concerning its 
genetic etiology. Based on mouse model studies, a disintergrin and
metalloprotease 10/17 (ADAM10 and ADAM17) are the key enzymes for the NOTCH and
ErbB pathways, which are critical pathways for heart development. Mutations in
these two genes have not been previously reported in human TOF patients. In this 
study, we sequenced ADAM10 and ADAM17 in a Han Chinese CHD cohort comprised of 80
TOF patients, 286 other CHD patients, and 480 matched healthy controls. Three
missense variants of ADAM17 were only identified in 80 TOF patients, two of which
(Y42D and L659P) are novel and not found in the Exome Aggregation Consortium
(ExAC) database. Point mutation knock-in (KI) and ADAM17 knock-out (KO) human
embryonic stem cells (hESCs) were generated by CRISPR/Cas9 and programmed to
differentiate into cardiomyocytes (CMs). Y42D or L659P KI cells or complete KO
cells all developed hypertrophy with disorganized sarcomeres. RNA-seq results
showed that phosphatidylinositide 3-kinases/protein kinase B (PI3K/Akt), which is
downstream of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling, was affected in 
both ADAM17 KO and KI hESC-CMs. In vitro experiments showed that these two
mutations are loss-of-function mutations in shedding heparin-binding EGF-like
growth factor (HB-EGF) but not NOTCH signaling. Our results revealed that CM
hypertrophy in TOF could be the result of mutations in ADAM17 which affects
HB-EGF/ErbB signaling.

Objective: Currently, no guidelines are established for pharmacogenomic testing
involving folate metabolic genes in long-term disease-modifying antirheumatic
drugs' (DMARD) therapies. We carefully investigated how common genetic variations
in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) influence cellular metabolic
kinetics in response to methotrexate (MTX). Designs: Two distinct cell models:
HepG2 with stabilized MTHFR inhibition using shRNA delivered by a Lentiviral
vector; and Epstein-Barr virus transformed human lymphoblasts expressing MTHFR
polymorphic allele 677C and 677T were used. Disease activity and DMARD use were
compared between MTHFR-677CC, CT and TT rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients in a
cross-sectional study (n=120). Results: Compared with MTHFR-CC, MTHFR-TT carriers
had lower mean weakly MTX dose (9.8 ± 3.3 compared with 12.1 ± 3.5, P<0.05). More
MTHFR-TT carriers (8/11, 73%) reported MTX-related side effects compared with
MTHFR-677CC (32/57, 56%) and MTHFR-677CT (30/51, 59%). No genotypic difference
was found in other DMARDs. At the same dose of MTX, lymphoblasts were more
sensitive in cell survival, protein and thymidine syntheses whereas HepG2 models 
were more susceptible to the inhibition of S-adenosylmethionine (adoMet)
synthesis. MTHFR-C677T altered protein turnover and folate mediated 1-carbon
metabolic fluxes in lymphoblasts with and without MTX. MTHFR function
significantly affected transmethylation fluxes and adoMet homeostasis but not
nucleotide biosyntheses in MTX-treated HepG2 cell-lines. Conclusion: Combining
cell models, kinetic studies, and genetic tests in humans, the present study
gives insight on how MTHFR effects hepatic transmethylation homeostasis during
MTX therapy. We provide platforms that help predict the genetic impact on
antifolate drugs, and further delineate tissue-specific target pathway in DMARD
therapies. We suggest that genetic factors should be taken into account in
clinical practice.

Cancer has become one of the most important diseases that affect human health and
life. The effects of cancer in the digestive system are particularly prominent.
Recently, long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) has attracted the attention of more and
more researchers and has become an emerging field of gene research. The lncRNA
growth arrest-specific 5 (GAS5) is a novel lncRNA that has attracted the
attention of researchers in recent years and plays an important role in the
development of tumors, especially in digestive system tumors. GAS5 was first
identified in a mouse cDNA library. It was generally considered that it has the
role of tumor suppressor genes, but there are still studies that have a certain
ability to promote cancer. Furthermore, the 5-bp indel polymorphism (rs145204276)
in the GAS5 promoter region also has a carcinogenic effect. The discovery of GAS5
and in-depth study of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) mechanism can provide 
a new way for the prevention and treatment of digestive system tumors.

Recent studies have shown the importance of cell-substrate interaction on neurone
outgrowth, where the Young's modulus of the matrix plays a crucial role on the
neurite length, migration, proliferation, and morphology of neurones. In the
present study, PC12 cells were selected as the representative neurone to be
cultured on hydrogel substrates with different stiffness to explore the effect of
substrate stiffness on the neurone outgrowth. By adjusting the concentration of
gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA), the hydrogel substrates with the variation of
stiffnesses (indicated by Young's modulus) from approximately 3-180 KPa were
prepared. It is found that the stiffness of GelMA substrates influences neuronal 
outgrowth, including cell viability, adhesion, spreading, and average neurite
length. Our results show a critical range of substrate's Young's modulus that
support PC12 outgrowth, and modulate the cell characteristics and morphology. The
present study provides an insight into the relationship between the stiffness of 
GelMA hydrogel substrates and PC12 cell outgrowth, and helps the design and
optimization of tissue engineering scaffolds for nerve regeneration.

Up-regulation of lncRNA POU3F3 has been observed in esophageal squamous cell
carcinomas, while its expression pattern and functionality in other human disease
is unknown. Our study showed that plasma levels of lncRNA POU3F3 and TGF-β1
(transforming growth factor-β) were both increased in nasopharyngeal carcinoma
patients than in healthy controls. Plasma levels of lncRNA POU3F3 were not
affected by the diameter of primary tumors but increased in patients with tumor
metastasis. Plasma levels of lncRNA POU3F3 and TGF-β1 were positively correlated 
only in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients but not in healthy controls. Follow-up 
study showed that high plasma levels of lncRNA POU3F3 were significantly
correlated with poor overall survival. LncRNA POU3F3 overexpression and exogenous
TGF-β1 treatment led to promoted, while TGF-β1 inhibitor led to inhibited
migration and invasion of nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells. TGF-β1 inhibitor
partially rescued the inhibited cancer cell migration and invasion caused by
lncRNA POU3F3 overexpression. LncRNA POU3F3 overexpression led to down-regulated 
TGF-β1 expression, while exogenous TGF-β1 and TGF-β1 inhibitor treatment did not 
significantly change the expression level of lncRNA POU3F3. Therefore, lncRNA
POU3F3 may promote cancer cell migration and invasion in nasopharyngeal carcinoma
by up-regulating TGF-β1.

This work tests bioenergetic and cell-biological implications of the synthetic
fatty acid Minerval (2-hydroxyoleic acid), previously demonstrated to act by
activation of sphingomyelin synthase in the plasma membrane (PM) and lowering of 
phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) and their carcinogenic
signaling. We show here that Minerval also acts, selectively in cancer cell
lines, as an ATP depleting uncoupler of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation
(OxPhos). As a function of its exposure time, Minerval compromised the capacity
of glioblastoma U87-MG cells to compensate for aberrant respiration by
up-modulation of glycolysis. This effect was not exposure time-dependent in the
lung carcinoma A549 cell line, which was more sensitive to Minerval. Compared
with OxPhos inhibitors FCCP (uncoupler), rotenone (electron transfer inhibitor), 
and oligomycin (F1F0-ATPase inhibitor), Minerval action was similar only to that 
of FCCP. This similarity was manifested by mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP)
depolarization, facilitation of oxygen consumption rate (OCR), restriction of
mitochondrial and cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and
mitochondrial fragmentation. Additionally, compared with other OxPhos inhibitors,
Minerval uniquely induced ER stress in cancer cell lines. These new modes of
action for Minerval, capitalizing on the high fatty acid requirements of cancer
cells, can potentially enhance its cancer-selective toxicity and improve its
therapeutic capacity.

A consensus about the prognostic role of NIMA-related kinase 2 (NEK2) expression 
in various solid tumors has not been made yet. Thus, this meta-analysis aimed to 
systematically assess the prognostic role of NEK2 expression in patients with
solid tumors. The eligible studies were identified through searching PubMed, Web 
of Science, and EMBASE. The hazard ratios (HRs) with their corresponding 95%
confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate the link between NEK2
overexpression and overall survival (OS) and disease-free
survival/recurrence-free survival (DFS/RFS) of patients with solid tumors. A
total of 17 studies with 4897 patients were included in this meta-analysis. Among
these studies, all of them explored the association between NEK2 expression and
OS of patients with solid tumors. Our pooled analysis indicated that NEK2
overexpression was significantly related to adverse OS (HR = 1.66; 95% CI:
1.38-2.00; P = 0.001). Additionally, there were six studies with 854 patients
that investigated the association between NEK2 expression and DFS/RFS. Our pooled
result indicated that there was a substantial relationship between NEK2
overexpression and poorer DFS/RFS (HR = 2.00; 95% CI: 1.61-2.48; P = 0.003). In
conclusion, our meta-analysis indicated that NEK2 may be a useful predictor of
prognosis and an effective therapeutic target in solid tumors. Nevertheless, more
high-quality studies are warranted to further support our conclusions because of 
several limitations in our meta-analysis.

Background and aims: Diabetic kidney is more sensitive to ischemia/reperfusion
(I/R) injury, which is associated with increased oxidative stress and impaired
nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1)
signaling. Melatonin, a hormone that is secreted with the rhythm of the
light/dark cycle, has antioxidative effects in reducing acute kidney injury
(AKI). However, the molecular mechanism of melatonin protection against kidney
I/R injury in the state of diabetes is still unknown. In the present study, we
hypothesized that melatonin attenuates renal I/R injury in diabetes by activating
silent information regulator 2 associated protein 1 (SIRT1) expression and
Nrf2/HO-1 signaling. Methods: Control or streptozotocin (STZ)-induced Type 1
diabetic rats were treated with or without melatonin for 4 weeks. Renal I/R
injury was achieved by clamping both left and right renal pedicles for 30 min
followed by reperfusion for 48 h. Results: Diabetic rats that were treated with
melatonin undergoing I/R injury prevented renal injury from I/R, in aspects of
the histopathological score, cell apoptosis, and oxidative stress in kidney,
accompanied with decreased expressions of SIRT1, Nrf2, and HO-1 as compared with 
those in control rats. All these alterations were attenuated or prevented by
melatonin treatment; but these beneficial effects of melatonin were abolished by 
selective inhibition of SIRT1 with EX527. Conclusion: These findings suggest
melatonin could attenuate renal I/R injury in diabetes, possibly through
improving SIRT1/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the associations between single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the PDZ and LIM domain protein 4 (PDLIM4) gene
and susceptibility to osteoporotic fracture in an elderly Han Chinese population.
Seven SNPs of PDLIM4, including rs77584624, rs78418541, rs270611, rs3900945,
rs77486529, rs71583465, and rs366512, were examined in 540 elderly Chinese
patients with osteoporotic fractures (case group) and 540 healthy Chinese
subjects (control group) using Sanger sequencing. A-allele carriers of rs270611
in PDLIM4 had a significantly high risk of osteoporotic fracture (adjusted odds
ratio [OR] = 1.34; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.24-1.46; P<0.001). Similarly, 
individuals carrying the C-allele at PDLIM4 rs3900945 were predisposed to
osteoporotic fracture (adjusted OR = 1.45; 95% CI: 1.05-1.25; P<0.001). In
contrast, the T-allele at rs366512 appeared to be a protective genetic factor
against osteoporotic fracture (adjusted OR = 0.84; 95% CI: 0.74-0.95; P<0.01).
Consistently, the serum levels of N-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen
(PINP) and C-telopeptide fragments of Collagen type I α1 chains (β-CTx) were
higher in A-allele carriers of rs270611 and C-allele carriers of rs3900945, while
T-allele carriers of rs366512 had lower PINP and β-CTx levels. Corresponding well
with published findings, the A-allele of rs270611 and C-allele of rs3900945 were 
associated with reduced bone marrow density (BMD) at the fracture site, while
T-allele carriers of rs366512 were shown to have normal BMD. Our study provides
supportive evidence for the contribution of PDLIM4 gene polymorphisms to the
susceptibility to osteoporotic fracture and suggests that rs270611 and rs3900945 
are genetic risk factors, while rs366512 might be a genetic protective factor
against osteoporotic fracture in elderly Han individuals.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae is one of the most common pathogenic causes of
community-acquired pneumonia. Hydrogen sulfide, alanine, and pyruvate producing
enzyme (HapE) is a recently discovered M. pneumoniae virulence factor that can
produce H2S to promote erythrocyte lysis. However, other cytotoxic effects of
HapE have not been explored. The present study examined the effects of this
enzyme on normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells, in an attempt to
identify additional mechanisms of M. pneumoniae pathogenesis. Recombinant HapE
was purified for use in downstream assays. MTT and colony formation assays were
conducted to determine the effects of HapE on cell viability and growth, while
flow cytometry was used to examine changes in cell proliferation and cell cycle
function. ELISA was performed to examine changes in the cytokine profile of
HapE-treated cells. HapE treatment arrested NHBE cells in S phase and inhibited
cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner. The anti-inflammatory
factors interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-6 were significantly enhanced following HapE
treatment. Increased secretion of pro-inflammatory factors was not observed. The 
effects of HapE on the respiratory epithelium may have an impact on the
efficiency of host immune surveillance and pathogen elimination, and contribute
to the pathogenesis of M. pneumoniae.

Shaoyao-Gancao Decoction (SGD) has been widely used for the treatment of
gynopathy. The present study aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effect and
potential mechanism of SGD on hyperandrogenism in polycystic ovary syndrome
(PCOS) rats. In the present work, SGD was orally administrated to the PCOS rats
at the dose of 12.5, 25, and 50 g/kg/d for 14 consecutive days. UPLC-MS/MS was
performed to identify the main chemical components of SGD. Body weight, ovarian
weight, cystic dilating follicles, and serum levels of steroid hormones were
tested to evaluate the therapeutic effect of SGD. In order to further clarify the
underlying mechanism, we also measured mRNA and the protein levels of NF-κB,
NF-κB p65, P-NF-κB p65, and IκB by RT-qPCR and Western blotting techniques. Our
results showed that SGD treatment significantly alleviated hyperandrogenism in
PCOS rats as evidenced by reduced serum levels of T and increased E2 and FSH
levels. In addition, SGD effectively reduced the phosphorylation of NF-κB p65 and
increased the expression of IκB. Results of the present study demonstrated that
SGD could ameliorate hyperandrogenism in PCOS rats, and the potential mechanism
may relate to the NF-κB pathway.

The TET (Ten-Eleven Translocation) proteins catalyze the oxidation of 5mC
(5-methylcytosine) to 5hmC (5-hydroxymethylcytosine) and play crucial roles in
embryonic development. Ascorbic acid (Vc, Vitamin C) stimulates the expression of
TET proteins, whereas DMOG (dimethyloxallyl glycine) inhibits TET expression. To 
investigate the role of TET1, TET2, and TET3 in PA (parthenogenetic) embryonic
development, Vc and DMOG treatments were administered during early embryonic
development. The results showed that Vc treatment increased the blastocyst rate
(20.73 ± 0.46 compared with 26.57 ± 0.53%). By contrast, DMOG reduced the
blastocyst rate (20.73 ± 0.46 compared with 11.18 ± 0.13%) in PA embryos. qRT-PCR
(quantitative real-time PCR) and IF (immunofluorescence) staining results
revealed that TET1, TET2, and TET3 expressions were significantly lower in PA
embryos compared with normal fertilized (Con) embryos. Our results revealed that 
Vc stimulated the expression of TET proteins in PA embryos. However, treatment
with DMOG significantly inhibited the expression of TET proteins. In addition,
5hmC was increased following treatment with Vc and suppressed by DMOG in PA
embryos. Taken together, these results indicate that the expression of TET
proteins plays crucial roles mediated by 5hmC in PA embryonic development.

Staining with Congo Red (CR) is a qualitative method used for the identification 
of amyloids in vitro and in tissue sections. However, the drawbacks and artefacts
obtained when using this dye can be found both in vitro and in vivo Analysis of
scientific data from previous studies shows that CR staining alone is not
sufficient for confirmation of the amyloid nature of protein aggregates in vitro 
or for diagnosis of amyloidosis in tissue sections. In the present paper, we
describe the characteristics and limitations of other methods used for amyloid
studies. Our historical review on the use of CR staining for amyloid studies may 
provide insight into the pitfalls and caveats related to this technique for
researchers considering using this dye.

Stargardt disease (STGD1, OMIM 248200) is a common hereditary juvenile or early
adult onset macular degeneration. It ultimately leads to progressive central
vision loss. Here, we sought to identify gene mutations associated with STGD1 in 
a three-generation Han Chinese pedigree by whole exome sequencing and Sanger
sequencing. Two novel potentially pathogenic variants in a compound heterozygous 
state, c.3607G>T (p.(Gly1203Trp)) and c.6722T>C (p.(Leu2241Pro)), in the ATP
binding cassette subfamily A member 4 gene (ABCA4) were identified as
contributing to the family's STGD1 phenotype. These variants may impact the ABCA4
protein structure and reduce the retinal-activated ATPase activity, leading to
abnormal all-trans retinal accumulation in photoreceptor outer segments and in
retinal pigment epithelium cells. The present study broadens the mutational
spectrum of the ABCA4 responsible for STGD1. A combination of whole exome
sequencing and Sanger sequencing is likely to be a time-saving and cost-efficient
approach to screen pathogenic variants in genetic disorders caused by sizable
genes, as well as avoiding misdiagnosis. These results perhaps refine genetic
counseling and ABCA4-targetted treatments for families affected by STGD1.

INTRODUCTION: Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC) is a highly aggressive
malignant cancer, but the molecular mechanisms underlying its development and
progression remain largely elusive. The purpose of the present study is to
investigate the expression profile and functional role of microRNA-625 (miR-625) 
in LSCC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: LSCC tissues and adjacent normal tissues were collected
from 86 LSCC patients. The expression levels of miR-625 and SOX4 mRNA in tissues 
and cells were detected by RT-qPCR analysis. The expression levels of SOX4 and
EMT-related proteins were detected by western blot analysis. In vitro cell
proliferation, migration, and invasion were detected by MTT assay, colony
formation assay, wound healing assay, and transwell invasion assay, respectively.
Dual-luciferase reporter assay was performed to verify the binding relationship
between miR-625 and the 3'-UTR of SOX4.
RESULTS: The results demonstrated that miR-625 is significantly down-regulated in
clinical LSCC tissues, and its low expression may be closely associated with
unfavorable clinicopathological characteristics of LSCC patients. Overexpression 
of miR-625 significantly suppressed the proliferation, migration, invasion, and
EMT of LSCC cells. Furthermore, SOX4 was validated as a direct target of miR-625 
in LSCC cells, and rescue experiments suggested that restoration of SOX4 blocked 
the tumor suppressive role of miR-625 in LSCC cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these findings highlighted a critical role of
miR-625 in the pathogenesis of LSCC, and restoration of miR-625 could be
considered as a potential therapeutic strategy against this fatal disease.

This study was investigated the effects of dietary supplementation of leucine and
phenylalanine on the development of the gastrointestinal tract and the intestinal
digestive enzyme activity in male Holstein dairy calves. Twenty calves with a
body weight of 38 ± 3 kg at 1 day of age were randomly divided into four groups: 
a control group, a leucine group (1.435 g·l-1), a phenylalanine group (0.725
g·l-1), and a mixed amino acid group (1.435 g·l-1 leucine plus 0.725 g·l-1
phenylalanine). The supplementation of leucine decreased the short-circuit
current (Isc) of the rumen and duodenum (P<0.01); phenylalanine did not show any 
influence on the Isc of rumen and duodenum (P>0.05), and also counteracted the
Isc reduction caused by leucine. Leucine increased the trypsin activity at the
20% relative site of the small intestine (P<0.05). There was no difference in the
activity of α-amylase and of lactase in the small intestinal chyme among four
treatments (P>0.05). The trypsin activity in the anterior segment of the small
intestine was higher than other segments, whereas the α-amylase activity in the
posterior segment of the small intestine was higher than other segments. Leucine 
can reduce Isc of the rumen and duodenum, improve the development of the
gastrointestinal tract, and enhance trypsin activity; phenylalanine could inhibit
the effect of leucine in promoting intestinal development.

Ribosomes are responsible for the synthesis of all cellular proteins. Due to the 
diversity of sequence and properties, it was initially believed that translating 
nascent chains would travel unhindered through the ribosome exit tunnel, however 
a small but increasing number of proteins have been identified that interact with
the exit tunnel to induce translational arrest, Escherichia coli (E. coli)
secretion monitor (SecM) is one such stalling peptide. How and why these peptides
interact with the exit tunnel is not fully understood, however key features
required for stalling appear to be an essential peptide arrest motif at the
C-terminus and compaction of the nascent chain within the exit tunnel upon
stalling. Mutagenesis of the SecM arrest sequence has identified three
conservative point mutations that can retain a degree of stalling in this highly 
conserved sequence. This level of stalling is further increased when coupled with
mutation of a non-essential arrest motif residue P153A. Further analysis of these
mutants by pegylation assays indicates that this increase in stalling activity
during translation is due to the ability of the P153A mutation to reintroduce
compaction of the nascent chain within the exit tunnel possibly due to the
improved flexibility of the nascent chain provided by the removal of a
restrictive proline residue. The data presented here suggest that arrest
sequences may be more prevalent and less highly conserved than previously
thought, and highlight the significance of the interactions between the nascent
chain and the exit tunnel to affecting translation arrest.

The effect of Cereus jamacaru ethanolic extract in rats was analyzed using
genotoxicity assays and liver ABCB1 and CYP2D4 gene expression. The lyophilized
extract of C. jamacaru cladodes was analyzed with LC-MS/MS. Male Wistar rats
(n=36) were equally distributed into six groups that did (+) or did not (-)
receive cyclophosphamide treatments: Control (-); Control (+); EXP 1 (-), and EXP
1 (+), both treated with 210 mg/kg of ethanolic extract; and EXP 2 (-) and EXP 2 
(+), both treated with 420 mg/kg of ethanolic extract. After 30 d of treatment,
body weight and food and water intake were monitored. Right femur of the rats and
spinal canal fluid were harvested and used for genotoxicity assays, and the liver
samples were used for gene expression studies. The phytochemical analysis
identified novel compounds. Animals treated with C. jamacaru showed lower body
weight and food ingestion compared to controls (P<0.05). The genotoxicity assay
showed an absence of ethanolic extract cytotoxicity. CYP2D4 expression was higher
in EXP 2 groups compared with EXP 1 (-) group (P<0.05). ABCB1A expression was
higher in negative groups compared with the positive groups. These results
indicated a new phytochemical characterization of C. jamacaru and its effect on
food ingestion and body weight gain. Moreover, the genotoxicity assay suggested
that C. jamacaru ethanolic extract treatment presents significant intrinsic
genotoxic potential and the enhanced expression of ABCB1 and CYP2D4 on C.
jamacaru extract treatment suggests a role of the efflux transporter and
microsomal enzyme, respectively, in C. jamacaru pharmacokinetics.

Purpose: Melanosis coli (MC) is a disorder of pigmentation of the wall of the
colon, often identified at the time of colonoscopy. The aim of the present study 
is to identify candidate biomarkers for MC. Methods: The transcriptome data for
MC (GSE78933) with five MC tissues and five corresponding normal tissues is
obtained from the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. R/Bioconductor
package limma was used to screen differently expressed genes (DEGs). ClueGO of
cytoscape was applied for Gene Ontology (GO) functional and Kyoto Encyclopedia of
Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment. Based on STRING V10 database,
protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed. The pathological
tissue and normal tissue from 23 MC patients and 23 controls were collected,
respectively. The relative expression of hub nodes was detected by qRT-PCR and
Western blot. For regulating the expression of these genes, overexpression vector
was constructed or siRNA transfection was used. Finally, apoptosis was detected
by flow cytometry. Results: Total 1342 DEGs were screened, including 786
up-regulated and 556 down-regulated genes. These genes were mainly enriched in
stimulatory C-type lectin receptor signaling pathway, polysaccharide biosynthetic
process, intracellular, and oxidative phosphorylation. PPI network was then
constructed with 426 DEGs and 895 interactions. Thereinto, G-protein subunit γ 5 
(GNG5), lysophosphatidic acid receptor 3 (LPAR3), mitogen-activated protein
kinase 8 (MAPK8), NHP2L1, proteasome 26S subunit, ATPase 6 (PSMC6), and
phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase catalytic subunit β (PIK3CB) were 
hub nodes with higher degree. RT-PCR and Western blot results showed that GNG5,
LPAR3, MAPK8, and PSMC6 were differently expressed with significance. The
expression of these screened genes is also related with cell apoptosis.
Conclusion: GNG5, LPAR3, MAPK8, and PSMC6 might be candidate biomarkers
associated with apoptosis in MC.

Plenty of studies have investigated the effect of methionine synthase (MTR)
A2756G polymorphism on risk of developing pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
(ALL), but the available results were inconsistent. Therefore, a meta-analysis
was conducted to derive a more precise estimation of the association between MTR 
A2756G polymorphism and genetic susceptibility to pediatric ALL. The PubMed,
Embase, Google Scholar, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Wanfang Databases and
China National Knowledge Infrastructure were systematically searched to identify 
all the previous published studies exploring the relationship between MTR A2756G 
polymorphism and pediatric ALL risk. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) were applied to evaluate the strength of association. Sensitivity
analysis and publication bias were also systematically assessed. This
meta-analysis finally included ten available studies with 3224 ALL cases and 4077
matched controls. The results showed that there was significant association
between MTR A2756G polymorphism and risk of pediatric ALL in overall population

95%CI = 1.02-1.25, P = 0.01; G allele vs. A allele: OR = 1.10, 95%CI = 1.01-1.20,
P = 0.03). In the stratification analyses by ethnicity, quality score and control
source, significant association was found in Caucasians, population-based
designed studies and studies assigned as high quality. In conclusion, this
meta-analysis suggests that MTR A2756G polymorphism may influence the development
risk of pediatric ALL in Caucasians. Future large scale and well-designed studies
are required to validate our findings.

Influenza viruses cause seasonal epidemics and sporadic pandemics in humans. The 
virus's ability to change its antigenic nature through mutation and
recombination, and the difficulty in developing highly effective universal
vaccines against it, make it a serious global public health challenge. Influenza 
virus's surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, are all modified 
by the host cell's N-linked glycosylation pathways. Host innate immune responses 
are the first line of defense against infection, and glycosylation of these major
antigens plays an important role in the generation of host innate responses
toward the virus. Here, we review the principal findings in the analytical
techniques used to study influenza N-linked glycosylation, the evolutionary
dynamics of N-linked glycosylation in seasonal versus pandemic and zoonotic
strains, its role in host innate immune responses, and the prospects for
lectin-based therapies. As the efficiency of innate immune responses is a
critical determinant of disease severity and adaptive immunity, the study of
influenza glycobiology is of clinical as well as research interest.

Mammalian myosin-5b (Myo5b) plays a critical role in the recycling of endosomes
to the plasma membrane via the interactions with Rab11a and the Rab11 family
interacting protein 2 (FIP2). However, it remains unclear on how Rab11a and FIP2 
are coordinated in tethering Myo5b with the vesicles and activating the motor
function of Myo5b. In the present study, we show that Rab11a binds to the
globular tail domain (GTD) of Myo5b and this binding abolishes the head-GTD
interaction of Myo5b, thus activating the motor function of Myo5b. On the other
hand, FIP2 directly interacts with both Rab11a and the tail of Myo5b, and the
binding of FIP2 to Myo5b does not affect Myo5b motor function. Moreover, Rab11a
displays higher affinity to FIP2 than to Myo5b, suggesting that Rab11a binds
preferentially to FIP2 than to Myo5b. Based on the current findings, we propose
that the association of Myo5b with vesicles is mediated by FIP2, which bridges
Myo5b and the membrane-bound Rab11a, whereas the motor function of Myo5b is
regulated by Rab11a.

The present study aimed to explore miR-125 effects on rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
development to provide a potential target for RA. Briefly, rat RA model was
established (Model group) by injection of Freund's Complete Adjuvant into the
left hind toe. Normal rats injected with saline in the same location were set as 
Normal group. All rats' secondary foot swelling degree, polyarthritis index
score, spleen and thymus index were measured. Synovial tissues were subjected to 
Hematoxylin-Eosin (HE) staining and immunohistochemistry. Synovial cells of each 
group were isolated and named as Normal-C group and Model-C group, respectively. 
Synovial cells of Model-C group further underwent cotransfection with miR-125
mimics and PARP2-siRNA (mimics+siPARP2 group) or with miR-125 negative control
(NC) and PARP2-siRNA NC (NC group). Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR
(qRT-PCR), Western blot, luciferase reporter assay, ELISA, and MTT assay were
performed. As a result, compared with Normal group, rats of Model group showed
significantly higher secondary foot swelling degree, polyarthritis index score,
spleen and thymus index (P<0.01). Down-regulated miR-125 and up-regulated PARP2
was found in synovial tissues of Model group when compared with Normal group
(P<0.01). Synovial tissues of Model-C group exhibited severe hyperplasia and
inflammatory cell infiltration. Luciferase reporter assay indicated that PARP2
was directly inhibited by miR-125. Compared with NC group, cells of
mimics+siPARP2 group had significantly lower IL-1β, MMP-1 and TIMP-1 levels,
absorbance value, and p-PI3K, p-Akt and p-mTOR relative expression (P<0.01 or
P<0.05). Thus, miR-125 might attenuate RA development by regulating PI3K/Akt/mTOR
signaling pathway via directly inhibiting PARP2 expression.

Lung adenocarcinoma (LAD) is one of the most common malignancies that threats
human health worldwide. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been reported to play
significant roles in tumorigenesis and might be novel biomarkers and targets for 
diagnosis and treatment of cancers. TP73-AS1 is a newly discovered lncRNA
involved in the tumorigenesis and development of several cancers. However, its
role in LAD has not been investigated yet. In the present study, we first found
that TP73-AS1 expression was markedly increased in LAD tissues and cell lines and
its overexpression was strongly associated with poor clinical outcomes. Then the 
loss/gain-of-function assays elucidated that TP73-AS1 contributed to cell
proliferation, migration, and invasion in vitro, and the in vivo experiments
illustrated that its knockdown inhibited tumor growth and metastasis. What was
more, we discovered that phosphoinositide 3-kinase and AKT (PI3K/AKT) pathway was
activated both in LAD tissues and cell lines but inactivated under TP73-AS1
silence. Moreover, the activation of this pathway could rescue the inhibitory
effects of TP73-AS1 suppression on LAD cellular processes partially. These data
suggested that TP73-AS1 served as an oncogene in LAD partially through activating
PI3K/AKT pathway and it could be a potential target for diagnosis and treatment
of LAD.

Hemin is an erythropoietic inductor capable of inducing autophagy in
erythroid-like cell lines. Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1
(LRP1) is a transmembrane receptor involved in a wide range of cellular
processes, such as proliferation, differentiation, and metabolism. Our aim was to
evaluate whether LRP1 is responsible for hemin activity in K562 cells, with the
results demonstrating a three-fold increase in LRP1 gene expression levels
(P-values <0.001) when assessed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR).
Moreover, a 70% higher protein amount was observed compared with control
condition (P-values <0.01) by Western blot (WB). Time kinetic assays demonstrated
a peak in light chain 3 (LC3) II (LC3II) levels after 8 h of hemin stimulation
and the localization of LRP1 in the autophagosome structures. Silencing LRP1 by
siRNA decreased drastically the hemin-induced autophagy activity by almost 80%
compared with control cells (P-values <0.01). Confocal localization and
biochemical analysis indicated a significant redistribution of LRP1 from early
endosomes and recycling compartments to late endosomes and autophagolysosomes,
where the receptor is degraded. We conclude that LRP1 is responsible for
hemin-induced autophagy activity in the erythroblastic cell line and that
hemin-LRP1 complex activation promotes a self-regulation of the receptor. Our
results suggest that hemin, via the LRP1 receptor, favors erythroid maturation by
inducing an autophagic response, making it a possible therapeutic candidate to
help in the treatment of hematological disorders.

Characterization of the distinct mechanism of agonist-induced canine platelet
activation.

National University, Cheongju 28644, Korea.

Platelet activation has a major role in hemostasis and thrombosis. Various
agonists including adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and thrombin interact with G
protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) which transduce signals through various G
proteins. Recent studies have elucidated the role of GPCRs and their
corresponding G proteins in the regulation of events involved in platelet
activation. However, agonist-induced platelet activation in companion animals has
not been elucidated. This study was designed to characterize the platelet
response to various agonists in dog platelets. We found that
2-methylthio-ADP-induced dog platelet aggregation was blocked in the presence of 
either P2Y₁ receptor antagonist MRS2179 or P2Y₁₂ receptor antagonist AR-C69931MX,
suggesting that co-activation of both the P2Y₁ and P2Y₁₂ receptors is required
for ADP-induced platelet aggregation. Thrombin-induced dog platelet aggregation
was inhibited in the presence of either AR-C69931MX or the PKC inhibitor
GF109203X, suggesting that thrombin requires secreted ADP to induce platelet
aggregation in dog platelets. In addition, thrombin-mediated Akt phosphorylation 
was inhibited in the presence of GF109203X or AR-C69931MX, indicating that
thrombin causes Gi stimulation through the P2Y₁₂ receptor by secreted ADP in dog 
platelets. Unlike human and murine platelets, protease-activated receptor 4
(PAR4)-activating peptide AYPGKF failed to cause dog platelet aggregation.
Moreover, PAR1-activating peptide SFLLRN or co-stimulation of SFLLRN and AYPGKF
failed to induce dog platelet aggregation. We conclude that ADP induces platelet 
aggregation through the P2Y₁ and P2Y₁₂ receptors in dogs. Unlike human and murine
platelets, selective activation of the PAR4 receptor may be insufficient to cause
platelet aggregation in dog platelets.

A total of 123 Coxiella burnetii strains detected in cattle from a nationwide
survey in Korea were classified into five genomic groups: I (0.8%), II (14.6%),
III (12.2%), IV (66.7%), and V (5.7%). Acute Q-fever strains (Groups I, II, and
III) comprised 27.6% and chronic strains (Groups IV and V) comprised 72.4%. At a 
dairy farm where both types were present, the detection rate was 6.7-times higher
than that of another farm where only chronic strains were detected. Both acute
and chronic Q-fever strains are widespread in Korea, and their presence could
represent an active transmission to livestock and humans.

Anthrax, caused by Bacillus anthracis, is a non-contagious infectious disease
that affects a wide range of animal species (primarily ruminants) including
humans. Due to the often-fatal outcome in humans, quick administration of
definitely effective antimicrobials is crucial either as prophylaxis or as a
clinical case therapy. In this study, 110 B. anthracis strains, temporally,
geographically, and genetically different, isolated during anthrax outbreaks in
Italy from 1984 to 2017, were screened using a broth microdilution method to
determine their susceptibility to 16 clinically relevant antimicrobial agents.
The strains were isolated from various matrices (human, animal, and environmental
samples) and were representative of thirty distinct genotypes previously
identified by 15-loci multiple-locus variable-number of tandem repeats analysis. 
The antimicrobials tested were gentamicin, ceftriaxone, streptomycin, penicillin 
G, clindamycin, chloramphenicol, vancomycin, linezolid, cefotaxime, tetracycline,
erythromycin, rifampin, amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, and
trimethoprim. All isolates were susceptible to most of the tested antimicrobials,
with the exception of trimethoprim for which all of them showed high minimal
inhibitory concentration values. An intermediate level of susceptibility was
recorded for ceftriaxone and cefotaxime. Although the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention recommend the use of doxycycline, ciprofloxacin, penicillin G, and
amoxicillin for treatment of human cases and for post-exposure prophylaxis to
anthrax spores, this study shows a high degree of in vitro susceptibility of B.
anthracis to many other antimicrobials, suggesting the possibility of an
alternative choice for prophylaxis and therapy.

Genome-wide association study (GWAS) is a powerful tool for identifying the
genetic causes of various diseases. This study was conducted to identify genomic 
variation in Maltese dog genomes associated with degenerative mitral valve
disease (DMVD) development and to evaluate the association of each biological
condition with DMVD in Maltese dogs. DNA was extracted from blood samples
obtained from 48 Maltese dogs (32 with DMVD and 16 controls). Genome-wide single 
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping was performed. The top 30 SNPs from each
association of various conditions and genetic variations were mapped to their
gene locations. A total of 173,662 loci were successfully genotyped, with an
overall genotype completion rate of 99.41%. Quality control analysis excluded
46,610 of these SNPs. Manhattan plots were produced using allelic tests with
various candidate clinical conditions. A significant peak of association was
observed between mitral valve prolapse (MVP) and SNPs on chromosome 17. The
present study revealed significant SNPs in several genes associated with cardiac 
function, including PDZ2, Armadillo repeat protein detected in velo-cardio-facial
syndrome, catenin (cadherin-associated protein) alpha 3, low-density lipoprotein 
receptor class A domain containing protein 4, and sterile alpha motif domain
containing protein 3. To our knowledge, this is the first study of a genetic
predisposition to DMVD in Maltese dogs. Although only a limited number of cases
were analyzed, these data could be the basis for further research on the genetic 
predisposition to MVP and DMVD in Maltese dogs.

White blood cells (WBCs) and storage period are the main factors of transfusion
reactions. In the present study, cytokine/chemokine concentrations after
leukoreduction (LR) and irradiation (IR) in stored canine whole blood were
measured. Red blood cell storage lesion caused by IR and LR were also compared.
Blood samples from 10 healthy Beagles were divided into four groups (no
treatment, LR-, IR-, and LR + IR-treated). Leukocytes were removed by filtration 
in the LR group and gamma radiation (25 Gy) was applied in the IR group.
Immunologic factors (WBCs, interleukin-6 [IL-6], C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 8
[CXCL-8], and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) and storage lesion factors (blood pH, 
potassium, and hemolysis) were evaluated on storage days 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28.
Compared to the treated groups, IL-6 and CXCL-8 concentrations during storage
were significantly higher in the control (no treatment) group. LR did not show
changes in cytokine/chemokine concentrations, and storage lesion presence was
relatively mild. IR significantly increased CXCL-8 after 14 days of storage, but 
IR of leukoreduced blood did not increase CXCL-8 during 28 days of storage.
Storage lesions such as hemolysis, increased potassium, and low pH were observed 
7 days after IR and storage of blood, regardless of LR. IR of leukoreduced blood 
is beneficial to avoid immune reactions; however, storage lesions should be
considered upon storage.

Inactive mammalian tolloid-like 1 (tll1) and mutations detected in tolloid-like 1
(TLL1) have been linked to the lack of the heart septa formation in mice and to a
similar human inborn condition called atrial-septal defect 6 (ASD6; OMIM 613087, 
formerly ASD II). Previously, we reported four point mutations in TLL1 found in
approximately 20% of ASD6 patients. Three mutations in the coding sequence were
M182L, V238A, and I629V. In this work, we present the effects of these mutations 
on TLL1 function. Three recombinant cDNA constructs carrying the mutations and
one wild-type construct were prepared and then expressed in HT-1080 cells.
Corresponding recombinant proteins were analyzed for their metalloendopeptidase
activity using a native substrate, chordin. The results of these assays
demonstrated that in comparison with the native TLL1, mutants cleaved chordin and
procollagen I at significantly lower rates. CD analyses revealed significant
structural differences between the higher order structure of wild-type and mutant
variants. Moreover, biosensor-based assays of binding interactions between TLL1
variants and chordin demonstrated a significant decrease in the binding
affinities of the mutated variants. The results from this work indicate that
mutations detected in TLL1 of ASD6 patients altered its metalloendopeptidase
activity, structure, and substrate-binding properties, thereby suggesting a
possible pathomechanism of ASD6.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 21-23-nucleotide, short, non-coding RNAs that play
important roles in virtually all biological pathways in mammals and other
multicellular organisms. The association of miR-221 and miR-222 (miR-221/222) for
breast cancer is critical, but their detailed roles in its development and
progression remain unclear. In the present study, we found that miR-221/222 were 
consistently up-regulated in breast cancer tissues. We then investigated the
molecular mechanisms by which miR-221/222 contributed to breast cancer and
identified growth arrest-specific transcript 5 (GAS5) as a direct target gene of 
miR-221/222. In contrast with the up-regulated expression levels of miR-221/222, 
GAS5 levels were significantly down-regulated and negatively correlated with
miR-221/222 in breast cancer tissues. In addition, we showed that miR-221/222
inhibitors increased cellular apoptosis, miR-221/222 mimics decreased the cell
apoptosis in breast cancer cells, and restoration of GAS5 expression attenuated
the anti-apoptotic effects of miR-221/222 in breast cancer cells, indicating that
GAS5 was a direct mediator of miR-221/222 function. Finally, we showed that
miR-221/222 suppressed GAS5 expression significantly and enhanced tumor growth in
a mouse model of breast cancer xenografts. The present study highlighted the
important role of miR-221/222 as oncomiRs in breast cancer, which inhibited GAS5 
translation. These findings may provide a new perspective for the molecular
mechanism of breast carcinogenesis and provide a novel approach to the treatment 
of breast cancer.

Glutathione (GSH) transferase (GST) is an essential enzyme in cestodes for the
detoxification of xenobiotics. In Taenia solium, two GSTs (Ts25GST and Ts26GST
kDa) were isolated as a fraction (SGSTF) by GSH-Sepharose-4B. Both are located on
the tegument. Immunization assays with SGSTF reduced up to 90% of the parasitic
load in a murine model of cysticercosis. It prompted us to investigate how SGSTF 
induces this protective immune response. To test it, we exposed peritoneal
macrophages to SGSTF for 24 h; such exposure favored the production of IL-12,
TNF, and IL-10 as well as the expression of nitric oxide synthase 2 inducible
(Nos2) and CD86, but did not induce the expression of chitinase-like 3 (Chil3).
Confocal microscopy showed that the macrophages internalize the SGSTF which
co-localized after 1 h with MHC-II in their plasma membranes. Macrophages exposed
to SGSTF and co-cultured with anti-CD3 pre-activated T CD4+ cells, enhanced the
proliferation of CD4+ cells, induced high interferon-γ (IFN-γ) secretion, and
elevated the expression of CD25 and CD69, molecules associated with cell
activation. Similar assay using T CD4+ cells from DO11.10 mice and ovalbumin
(OVA) peptide+SGSTF as stimuli, showed enhanced cell proliferation and
OVA-specific IFN-γ secretion. These data are in-line with those indicating that
the P1, P5, and P6 peptides of Schistosoma japonicum 28GST highly promote T-cell 
proliferation and Th1 response in vitro We found that such peptides are also
present on Ts25GST and Ts26GST. It suggests that SGSTF activates peritoneal
macrophages to a classically activated-like phenotype, and that these macrophages
induce the differentiation of T CD4+ cells toward a Th1-type response.

The tetracycline repressor (TetR)-regulated system is a widely used tool to study
gene functions through control of its expression. Various effectors such as
tetracycline (Tc) and doxycycline (Dox) quickly induce or shut down gene
expression, but reversing gene expression has not been eligible due to long
half-lives of such effectors. Here, we found that procaspase activating compound 
1 (PAC-1) rapidly reduces transient expression of TetR-regulated green
fluorescent protein (GFP) in mammalian cells. Next, we applied PAC-1 to control
of expression of transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) protein, whose
downstream cellular events can be monitored by cell morphological changes. We
observed that PAC-1 quickly reduces TRPM7 expression, consequently affecting cell
morphology regulated by TRPM7. The present study demonstrates the first small
molecule that efficiently turns off the TetR-regulated gene expression in
mammalian cells, thereby precisely regulating the expression level of target
gene.

Apoptosis is widely known as programmed cell death eliciting no inflammatory
responses. The intricacy of apoptosis has been a focus of an array of researches,
accumulating a wealth of knowledge which led to not only a better understanding
of the fundamental process, but also potent therapies of diseases. The classic
intrinsic and extrinsic signaling pathways of apoptosis, along with regulatory
factors have been well delineated. Drugs and therapeutic measures designed based 
on current understanding of apoptosis have long been employed. Small-molecule
apoptosis inducers have been clinically used for eliminating morbid cells and
therefore treating diseases, such as cancer. Biologics with improved apoptotic
efficacy and selectivity, such as recombinant proteins and antibodies, are being 
extensively researched and some have been approved by the FDA. Apoptosis also
produces membrane-bound vesicles derived from disassembly of apoptotic cells, now
known as apoptotic bodies (ApoBDs). These little sealed sacs containing
information as well as substances from dying cells were previously regarded as
garbage bags until they were discovered to be capable of delivering useful
materials to healthy recipient cells (e.g., autoantigens). In this review,
current understandings and knowledge of apoptosis were summarized and discussed
with a focus on apoptosis-related therapeutic applications and ApoBDs.

Background: Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2)
play important roles in aortic pathophysiology. We aimed to evaluate the
contribution of TLR4 and MMP2 polymorphisms individually and complex interactions
between gene and risk factors in susceptibility to aortic aneurysm (AA) and its
subtypes. Methods: KASP method was adopted to detect TLR4rs11536889, rs1927914
and MMP2rs2285053 polymorphisms in 498 controls and 472 AA patients, including
212 abdominal AA (AAA) and 216 thoracic AA (TAA). Results: In the overall
analysis, MMP2rs2285053 TC genotype was correlated with TAA risk (P = 0.047, OR =
1.487). Stratified analysis revealed an increased AA risk in males with
TLR4rs1927914 TC genotype, while MMP2rs2285053 TC conferred an elevated AA risk
in the subjects ≤60 years, and its TC genotype and dominant model were associated
with TAA in the subjects ≤60 year. The interaction between TLR4rs1927914 and
MMP2rs2285053 was associated with AAA risk (P interaction = 0.028, OR = 2.913).
Furthermore, significant interaction between TLR4rs11536889 and dyslipidemia was 
observed for TAA risk, while TLR4rs1927914 could interact with hypertension and
diabetes to increase the risk of AA or its subtypes. Two-way interaction effect
of TLR4rs1927914 and MMP2rs2285053 was enhanced by diabetes or dyslipidemia.
Conclusion: TLR4 and MMP2 polymorphisms and their complex interactions with
cardiovascular risk factors contributed to aortic aneurysmal diseases.

Background: The association of tooth loss with mortality from all causes,
cardiovascular diseases (CVD), and coronary heart disease (CHD) has been studied 
for many years; however, the results are inconsistent.Method: PubMed, Embase, Web
of Knowledge, and Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register databases were
searched for papers published from 1966 to August 2018. We conducted
dose-response meta-analysis to quantitatively evaluate the relation between tooth
loss and risk of mortality from all causes, CVD, and CHD.Results: In the present 
study, 18 prospective studies conducted until August 2018 were considered
eligible for analysis. In the analysis of linear association, the summarized
relative risk (RR) values for each 10-, 20-, and 32-tooth loss for all-cause
mortality were 1.15 (1.11-1.19), 1.33 (1.23-1.29), and 1.57 (1.39-1.51),
respectively. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses showed consistent results. A
linear relationship was found among all-cause mortality, with P nonlinearity =
0.306. The susceptibility to all-cause mortality increased by almost 1.48 times
at very high tooth loss (28-32), and slight flattening of the curve was noted.
However, the summarized RR values for increment for 10-, 20-, and 32-tooth loss
were not or were marginally related to increased risk of mortality from CVD/CHD. 
Subgroup and sensitivity analyses revealed inconsistent results. Tooth loss
showed linear association with CHD mortality but not with CVD mortality. The
susceptibility to all-cause mortality increased by almost 1.48 and 1.70 times for
CVD and CHD, respectively, at very high tooth loss (28-32). The curve exhibited
slight flattening; however, no statistical significance was detected.Conclusion: 
In the meta-analysis, our findings confirmed the positive relationship between
tooth loss and susceptibility to all-cause mortality, but not for circulatory
mortality. However, the finding that tooth loss might play a harmful role in the 
development of all-cause mortality remains inconclusive. Tooth loss may be a
potential risk marker for all-cause mortality: however, their association must be
further validated through large prospective studies.

Turner syndrome (TS) is a congenital disease caused by complete or partial loss
of one X chromosome. Low bone mineral status is a major phenotypic characteristic
of TS that can not be fully explained by X chromosome loss, suggesting other
autosomal-linked mutations may also exist. Therefore, the present study aimed to 
detect potential genetic mutations in TS through examination of copy number
variation (CNV). Seventeen patients with TS and 15 healthy volunteer girls were
recruited. Array-based comparative genomic hybridization (a-CGH) was performed on
whole blood genomic DNA (gDMA) from the 17 TS patients and 15 healthy volunteer
girls to identify potential CNVs. The abnormal CNV of one identified gene
(CARD11) was verified by quantitative PCR. All cases diagnosed had TS based on
genotype examination and physical characteristics, including short stature and
premature ovarian failure. Three rare CNVs, located individually at 7p22.3,
7p22.2, and Xp22.33, where six genes (TTYH3, AMZ1, GNA12, BC038729, CARD11, and
SHOX (stature homeobox)) are located, were found in TS patients. Quantitative PCR
confirmed the CNV of CARD11 in the genome of TS patients. Our results indicate
that CARD11 gene is one of the mutated genes involved in TS disease. However,
this CNV is rare and its contribution to TS phenotype requires further study.

Angiotensinogen (AGT) is the unique substrate of all angiotensin peptides. We
review the recent preclinical research of AGT antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), 
a rapidly evolving therapeutic approach. The scope of the research findings not
only opens doors for potentially new therapeutics of hypertension and many other 
diseases, but also provides insights into understanding critical physiological
and pathophysiological roles mediated by AGT.

We aimed to confirm the role of miR-1296-5p in gastric cancer and to identify its
target genes. The expression of miR-1296-5p was measured in gastric cancer
tissues and cell lines. The function of miR-1296-5p was examined by the
overexpression and inhibition of its expression in typical gastric cell lines as 
well as SGC-7901 and MGC-803 cells. The targets of miR-1296-5p were identified by
a luciferase activity assay. We found that miR-1296-5p was down-regulated in
gastric cancer tissue and cell lines, and low expression levels of miR-1296-5p
were associated with advanced clinical stage. Moreover, miR-1296-5p inhibited
cell proliferation, migration, and invasion in SGC-7901 and MGC-803 cells. Then, 
we identified CDK6 and EGFR as novel targets of miR-1296-5p by a luciferase
activity assay. Furthermore, the overexpression of miR-1296-5p suppressed the
expression of CDK6 and EGFR. Our results indicated a tumor-suppressive role of
miR-1296-5p through the translational repression of oncogenic CDK6 and EGFR in
gastric cancer.

Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the unicellular green algae, is the model organism for
studies in various physiological processes and for bioindustrial applications. To
explore the molecular mechanisms underlying physiological processes or to
establish engineered cell lines, the exogenous DNA needs to be integrated into
the genome for the insertional mutagenesis or transgene expression. However, the 
amount of selected marker DNA is not seriously considered in the existing
electroporation methods for mutants library construction. Here, we reported a
rapid-and-high-efficiency transformation technique for cell-walled strains using 
square-wave electroporation system. The final yield with this electroporation
method was 2-6 × 103 transformants per μg exogenous DNA for cell-walled strains
in a strain-dependent manner. In general, this electroporation technique was the 
easy and applicable way to build a mutant library for screening phenotypes of
interest.

Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) that are able to suppress T cell
function are a heterogeneous cell population frequently observed in cancer,
infection, and autoimmune disease. Immune checkpoint molecules, such as
programmed death 1 (PD-1) expressed on T cells and its ligand (PD-L1) expressed
on tumor cells or antigen-presenting cells, have received extensive attention in 
the past decade due to the dramatic effects of their inhibitors in patients with 
various types of cancer. In the present study, we investigated the expression of 
PD-1 on MDSCs in bone marrow, spleen, and tumor tissue derived from breast
tumor-bearing mice. Our studies demonstrate that PD-1 expression is markedly
increased in tumor-infiltrating MDSCs compared to expression in bone marrow and
spleens and that it can be induced by LPS that is able to mediate NF-κB
signaling. Moreover, expression of PD-L1 and CD80 on PD-1⁺ MDSCs was higher than 
on PD-1⁻ MDSCs and proliferation of MDSCs in a tumor microenvironment was more
strongly induced in PD-1⁺ MDSCs than in PD-1⁻ MDSCs. Although we could not
characterize the inducer of PD-1 expression derived from cancer cells, our
findings indicate that the study on the mechanism of PD-1 induction in MDSCs is
important and necessary for the control of MDSC activity; our results suggest
that PD-1⁺ MDSCs in a tumor microenvironment may induce tumor development and
relapse through the modulation of their proliferation and suppressive molecules.

NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1): an enzyme which needs just enough
mobility, in just the right places.

NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) catalyses the two electron reduction of
quinones and a wide range of other organic compounds. Its physiological role is
believed to be partly the reduction of free radical load in cells and the
detoxification of xenobiotics. It also has non-enzymatic functions stabilising a 
number of cellular regulators including p53. Functionally, NQO1 is a homodimer
with two active sites formed from residues from both polypeptide chains.
Catalysis proceeds via a substituted enzyme mechanism involving a tightly bound
FAD cofactor. Dicoumarol and some structurally related compounds act as
competitive inhibitors of NQO1. There is some evidence for negative cooperativity
in quinine oxidoreductases which is most likely to be mediated at least in part
by alterations to the mobility of the protein. Human NQO1 is implicated in
cancer. It is often over-expressed in cancer cells and as such is considered as a
possible drug target. Interestingly, a common polymorphic form of human NQO1,
p.P187S, is associated with an increased risk of several forms of cancer. This
variant has much lower activity than the wild-type, primarily due to its
substantially reduced affinity for FAD which results from lower stability. This
lower stability results from inappropriate mobility of key parts of the protein. 
Thus, NQO1 relies on correct mobility for normal function, but inappropriate
mobility results in dysfunction and may cause disease.

The management of dyspepsia in limited-resource areas has not been established.
In 2017, key opinion leaders throughout Thailand gathered to review and evaluate 
the current clinical evidence regarding dyspepsia and to develop consensus
statements, rationales, levels of evidence, and grades of recommendation for
dyspepsia management in daily clinical practice based on the Grading of
Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. This
guideline is mainly focused on the following 4 topics: (1) evaluation of patients
with dyspepsia, (2) management, (3) special issues (overlapping gastroesophageal 
reflux disease/irritable bowel syndrome and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drug/aspirin use), and (4) long-term follow-up and management to provide guidance
for physicians in Thailand and other limited-resource areas managing such
patients.

Proton pump inhibitors are commonly utilized for the treatment of gastric
acid-related diseases, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease, peptic ulcer
disease, and Helicobacter pylori infection, and for the prevention of low-dose
aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced peptic ulcers. Vonoprazan 
is a first-in-class potassium-competitive acid blocker, which has distinct
advantages compared to other conventional proton pump inhibitors in terms of the 
efficacy for acid suppression. Due to its strong gastric acid suppression
capabilities, vonoprazan serves as an effective drug for the treatment of
gastroesophageal reflux disease and H. pylori infection.

Post-operative ileus (POI) is an inevitable consequence of major abdominal
surgery, and may be prolonged in up to 30% of patients. Ileus is commonly
presumed to result from paralysis of the GI tract, though there is little direct 
evidence to support this view. The aim of this review is to systematically search
and critically review the literature investigating post-operative colonic
electrical and mechanical activity. MEDLINE and Embase databases were
systematically searched for articles investigating post-operative colonic motor
or electrical activity in human patients. Nineteen original articles
investigating post-operative colonic motor or electrical activity were
identified. Most studies have used low-resolution techniques, with intermittent
recordings of colonic motility. Numerous studies have shown that colonic
electrical and motor activity does not cease routinely following surgery, but is 
of abnormal character for 3-6 days following laparotomy. One recent
high-resolution manometry study identified hyperactive cyclic motor patterns
occurring in the distal colon on the first post-operative day. Low-resolution
studies have shown colonic slow waves are not inhibited by surgery, and are
present even in the immediate post-operative period. Recovery of normal motility 
appears to occur in a proximal to distal direction and is temporally correlated
with the clinical return of bowel function. No studies have investigated motility
specifically in prolonged POI. Future studies should use high-resolution
techniques to accurately characterise abnormalities in electrical and mechanical 
function underlying POI, and correlate these changes with clinical recovery of
bowel function.

Background: Microarray analysis of clinical aortic samples suggested a potential 
role for stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) in the modulation of aortic
medial degeneration (AMD), despite the uncertainty about STIM1 in normal aortic
smooth muscle cells (ASMCs). Here, we aimed to explore changes in STIM1
expression in AMD, and the possible mechanisms. Methods: An AMD model was
established using auto-delivery of angiotensin II (Ang II) into ApoE-/- mice. We 
assessed the effects of SKF96365, a STIM1 inhibitor, in AMD model and in vitro
cultured ASMCs. Elastic van Gieson (EVG) staining was used to visualize elastic
fiber injury. Mitochondria changes were viewed by TEM. Cytoplasmic calcium was
quantified by measuring fluo-4 staining in a flow cytometer. Mechanical
stretching device was used to mimic stretching that ASMCs experience in vivo Cell
apoptosis was determined by using Annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining. The
expression of STIM1, contractile related proteins (α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA),
myosin light chain (MLC)), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related proteins
(CHOP, activating transcription factor 6 (ATF-6)) and smad2/3 were assessed by
Western blotting, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and immunofluorescence (IF).
Results: SKF96365 exacerbated aortic injury in the AMD model. SKF96365 reduced
cytoplasmic calcium concentration in ASMCs, caused mitochondrial swelling, and
elevated the expression of ATF-6 and CHOP. SKF96365 decreased the expression of
MLC and α-SMA in ASMCs, causing them to be vulnerable to mechanical stretch.
SKF96365 suppressed smad2/3 activation after treatment with transforming growth
factor (TGF) β1 (TGFβ1). Conclusions: STIM1 is indispensable in ASMCs.
Interfering with STIM1 exaggerated the AMD process by modulating the expression
of contractile proteins, inducing ER stress in ASMCs.

Introduction: Renin angiotensin system (RAS) plays a role in idiopathic nephrotic
syndrome (INS). Most studies investigated only the classical RAS axis. Therefore,
the aims of the present study were to evaluate urinary levels of RAS molecules
related to classical and to counter-regulatory axes in pediatric patients with
INS, to compare the measurements with levels in healthy controls and to search
for associations with inflammatory molecules, proteinuria and disease treatment. 
Subjects and methods: This cross-sectional study included 31 patients with INS
and 19 healthy controls, matched for age and sex. Patients and controls were
submitted to urine collection for measurement of RAS molecules [Ang II,
Ang-(1-7), ACE and ACE2] by enzyme immunoassay and cytokines by Cytometric Bead
Array. Findings in INS patients were compared according to proteinuria: absent
(<150 mg/dl, n = 15) and present (≥150 mg/dl, n = 16). Results: In comparison to 
controls, INS patients had increased Ang II, Ang-(1-7) and ACE, levels while ACE2
was reduced. INS patients with proteinuria had lower levels of ACE2 than those
without proteinuria. ACE2 levels were negatively correlated with
24-h-proteinuria. Urinary concentrations of MCP-1/CCL2 were significantly higher 
in INS patients, positively correlated with Ang II and negatively with Ang-(1-7).
ACE2 concentrations were negatively correlated with IP-10/CXCL-10 levels, which, 
in turn, were positively correlated with 24-h-proteinuria. Conclusion: INS
patients exhibited changes in RAS molecules and in chemokines. Proteinuria was
associated with low levels of ACE2 and high levels of inflammatory molecules.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play an important role in gene regulation and show
greater tissue specificity and complexity of biological functions. There is
on-going research in their contribution in autoimmune diseases like multiple
sclerosis (MS). Our study aimed at the evaluation of serum levels of lncRNAs,
MALAT1 and lnc-DC in MS patients and the investigation of the association between
these lncRNAs and the disease activity. Serum from 45 MS patients and 45 healthy 
controls was separated. MALAT1 and lnc-DC expression levels were assayed by
qRT-PCR. MALAT1 and lnc-DC were significantly increased in MS patients (P=0.004
and P=0.006, respectively) in comparison with controls. There was a significant
increase in expression of MALAT1 in secondary progressive MS (SPMS) subgroup
compared with controls (P<0.0001); however, significant elevation of lnc-DC was
demonstrated in relapsing remitting MS (RRMS) subtype (P=0.003) compared with
normal controls. A positive association between the expression levels of MALAT1
and lnc-DC (r = 0.513, P < 0.0001) in MS patients was detected. Moreover,
positive correlation was observed between MALAT1and lnc-DC in RRMS (r = 0.569, P 
= 0.001). Serum levels of MALAT1 and lnc-DC may serve as potential novel
molecular biomarkers for MS diagnosis and may provide a new direction for its
treatment.

Heart failure (HF) is a serious disease with high mortality. The incidence of
this disease has continued to increase over the past decade. All cardiovascular
diseases causing dysfunction of various physiological processes can result in HF.
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), an energy sensor, has pleiotropic
cardioprotective effects and plays a critical role in the progression of HF. In
this review, we highlight that AMPK can not only improve the energy supply in the
failing heart by promoting ATP production, but can also regulate several
important physiological processes to restore heart function. In addition, we
discuss some aspects of some potential clinical drugs which have effects on AMPK 
activation and may have value in treating HF. More studies, especially clinical
trials, should be done to evaluate manipulation of AMPK activation as a potential
means of treating HF.

Background: Recently, the roles of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) polymorphisms 
in colorectal cancer (CRC) were analyzed by some pilot studies, with inconsistent
results. Therefore, we performed the present study to better assess the
relationship between TNF-α polymorphisms and the risk of CRC.Methods: Eligible
studies were searched in PubMed, Medline, Embase and CNKI. Odds ratios (ORs) and 
95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to assess correlations between TNF-α
polymorphisms and CRC.Results: A total of 22 studies were included for analyses. 
A significant association with the risk of CRC was detected for TNF-α -308 G/A
(recessive model: P = 0.004, OR = 1.42, 95%CI 1.12-1.79) polymorphism in overall 
analyses. Further subgroup analyses based on ethnicity of participants revealed
that TNF-α -238 G/A was significantly correlated with the risk of CRC in
Caucasians (dominant model: P = 0.01, OR = 0.47, 95%CI 0.26-0.86; overdominant
model: P = 0.01, OR = 2.27, 95%CI 1.20-4.30; allele model: P = 0.02, OR = 0.51,
95%CI 0.29-0.90), while -308 G/A polymorphism was significantly correlated with
the risk of CRC in Asians (recessive model: P = 0.001, OR = 2.23, 95%CI
1.38-3.63).Conclusions: Our findings indicated that TNF-α -238 G/A polymorphism
may serve as a potential biological marker for CRC in Caucasians, and TNF-α -308 
G/A polymorphism may serve as a potential biological marker for CRC in Asians.

We conducted comprehensive analyses to assess the diagnostic ability of miRNA-451
in cancers. A systematic online search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science,
China's national knowledge infrastructure, and VIP databases from inception to
July 31, 2017. The bivariate random effect model was used for calculating
sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio,
diagnostic odds ratio, and area under cure (AUC). The whole pooled sensitivity
and specificity were 0.85 (0.77-0.90) and 0.85 (0.78-0.90) with their 95%
confidence interval (95%CI), respectively. The pooled AUC was 0.91 (95%CI:
0.89-0.94). Positive likelihood ratio was 5.57 (95%CI: 3.74-8.31), negative
likelihood ratio was 0.18 (95%CI: 0.11-0.28), and diagnostic odds ratio was 31.33
(95%CI: 15.19-64.61). Among Asian population, the sensitivity and specificity
were 0.85 (95%CI: 0.77-0.91) and 0.86 (95%CI: 0.78-0.91), respectively. The
positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio were 5.87 (95%CI:
3.78-9.12) and 0.17 (95%CI: 0.11-0.28). The diagnostic odds ratio and AUC were
34.31 (15.51-75.91) and 0.92 (0.89-0.94). The pooled sensitivity, specificity,
positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, diagnostic odds ratio, and 
AUC for digestive system cancer were 0.83, 0.88, 6.87, 0.20, 35.13, and 0.92,
respectively. The other cancers were 0.87, 0.81, 4.55, 0.16, 28.51, and 0.90,
respectively. For sample source, the results still remain consistent. Our results
indicated miRNA-451 has a moderate diagnostic ability for cancers, and could be a
potential early screening biomarker, and considered as an adjuvant diagnostic
index when being combined with other clinical examinations.

PURPOSE: Tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), secreted by the activated macrophages, 
may participate in the onset and progression of colorectal cancer (CRC). The
association of TNF-α -308 G>A (rs1800629) single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
with CRC risk has been investigated by many studies but the results are
inconclusive. A trial sequential meta-analysis was performed for precise
estimation of the relationship between TNF-α -308 G>A gene polymorphism with CRC 
risk.
METHODS: Medline (PubMed), EMBASE (Excerpta-Medica) and Google Scholar were mined
for relevant articles. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were 
calculated to estimate the significance of association.
RESULTS: The pooled analysis indicated no risk associated with TNF-α -308 G>A SNP
and overall CRC risk in five genetic comparison models, i.e. allelic (A vs. G: P 
= 0.524; OR = 1.074, 95% CI = 0.863-1.335), homozygous (AA vs. GG: P = 0.489; OR 
= 1.227, 95% CI = 0.688-2.188), heterozygous (AG vs. GG: P = 0.811; OR = 1.024,
95% CI = 0.843-1.244), dominant (AA+AG vs. GG: P = 0.630; OR = 1.055, 95% CI =
0.849-1.311) and recessive (AA vs. AG+GG: P = 0.549; OR = 1.181, 95% CI =
0.686-2.033). Subgroup analysis revealed that TNF-α -308 G>A SNP is associated
with reduced risk of CRC in Asian ethnicity. The study showed no publication
bias.
CONCLUSIONS: No association of TNF-α -308 G>A SNP with overall CRC risk was
found. This SNP is likely to be protective against CRC in Asian population when
compared with Caucasian population. Larger prospective-epidemiological studies
are warranted to elucidate the roles of TNF-α -308 G>A SNP in the etiology of CRC
and to endorse the present findings.

LncRNA HAND2-AS1 is characterized as a tumor suppressor involved in several types
of malignancies, but its role in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is unknown.
Our study was carried out to investigate the involvement of lncRNA HAND2-AS1 in
NSCLC. In our study, we observed that levels of HAND2-AS1 were lower in tumor
tissues than that in adjacent healthy tissues. Compared with healthy controls,
plasma levels of HAND2-AS1 were lower, while levels of transforming growth factor
β (TGF-β) were higher in NSCLC patients. A significant negative correlation
between plasma levels of HAND2-AS1 and TGF-β1 was found in NSCLC patients but not
in healthy controls. LncRNA HAND2-AS1 overexpression inhibits, while exogenous
TGF-β1 treatment promotes cell migration and invasion ability and cancer cell
stemness. Cancer cells with lncRNA HAND2-AS1 overexpression showed down-regulated
TGF-β1, while TGF-β1 treatment showed no significant effects on lncRNA HAND2-AS1 
expression. TGF-β1 attenuated the inhibitory effects of lncRNA HAND2-AS1
overexpression on cell migration, invasion and stemness. We concluded that lncRNA
HAND2-AS1 may regulate the migration, invasion and stemness of NSCLC cells
through interactions with TGF-β1.

Hepatotoxicity is a severe problem generally faced by tuberculosis (TB) patients.
It is a well-known adverse reaction due to anti-TB drugs in TB patients
undergoing long-term treatment. The studies published previously have explored
the connection of N-acetyltransferase 2 (NAT2) gene polymorphisms with
isoniazid-induced hepatotoxicity, but the results obtained were inconsistent and 
inconclusive. A comprehensive trial sequence meta-analysis was conducted
employing 12 studies comprising 3613 controls and 933 confirmed TB cases using
the databases namely, EMBASE, PubMed (Medline) and Google Scholar till December
2017. A significant association was observed with individuals carrying variant
allele at position 481C>T (T vs. C: P = 0.001; OR = 1.278, 95% CI =
1.1100-1.484), at position 590G>A (A vs. G: P = 0.002; OR = 1.421, 95% CI =
1.137-1.776) and at position 857G>A (A vs. G: P = 0.0022; OR = 1.411, 95% CI =
1.052-1.894) to higher risk of hepatotoxicity vis-à-vis wild-type allele.
Likewise, the other genetic models of NAT2 gene polymorphisms have also shown
increased risk of hepatotoxicity. No evidence of publication bias was observed.
These results suggest that genetic variants of NAT2 gene have significant role in
isoniazid induced hepatotoxicity. Thus, NAT2 genotyping has the potential to
improve the understanding of the drug-enzyme metabolic capacity and help in early
predisposition of isoniazid-induced hepatotoxicity.

Lactate dehydrogenase A (LDH-A) is a key enzyme during glycolysis, which
increases the synthesis of related proteins and has elevated activity in cancer
cells. The role of LDH-A in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) progression was
investigated in the present study. Expression levels of LDH-A were assessed in
LUAD samples, and the relationship between LDH-A expression status and the
prognosis of LUAD patients was confirmed. The effect of LDH-A on proliferation,
invasion, migration, and colony formation of cancer cells was assessed. We
further determined the role of LDH-A in tumor growth in vivo by using xenograft
LUAD tumor models. The potential mechanism of LDH-A promotion in LUAD progression
was explored. LDH-A showed an abnormally high expression in LUAD, which is
closely associated with poor prognosis in patients with LUAD. In in vitro
experiments, silencing LDH-A expression in LUAD cells could effectively inhibit
proliferation, invasion, migration, and colony formation of cancer cells. In in
vivo experiments, tumor growth was markedly inhibited by LDH-A silencing in a
xenograft model of LUAD. Notably, LDH-A could also promote tumor progression by
regulating epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related molecules. LDH-A can
promote the malignant biological behaviors of LUAD cells, and thus can be a
potential target for LUAD treatment.

Gastroparesis and Functional Dyspepsia: A Blurring Distinction of Pathophysiology
and Treatment.

Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, USA.

Gastroparesis and functional dyspepsia are 2 of the most common gastric
neuromuscular disorders. These disorders are usually confused, having both
similarities and differences. The pathophysiology of these disorders involves
abnormal gastric motility, visceral hypersensitivity, mucosal inflammation, and
various cellular changes. Both disorders have similar symptoms such as epigastric
pain or discomfort, early satiety, and bloating. If patients suspected of having 
either gastroparesis or functional dyspepsia present with upper gastrointestinal 
symptoms, they should undergo upper endoscopy to exclude an alternative organic
cause. Although the gastric emptying rate is frequently assessed during the
clinical workup of patients with gastroparesis or functional dyspepsia, the
correlation between gastric emptying and the symptoms is generally poor. Once the
diagnosis of gastroparesis or functional dyspepsia is made, treatment should
focus on the predominant symptom. Recently, various treatment modalities have
been developed and validated. Prokinetic agents are generally used as treatment
for both gastroparesis and functional dyspepsia. Acid-suppressive therapy,
Helicobacter pylori eradication, and use of drugs that enhance gastric
accommodation are employed for functional dyspepsia. Psychoactive drugs are also 
effective in symptom control. For gastroparesis, antiemetic agents, ghrelin
receptor agonists, and serotonergic agents are used aside from prokinetic agents.
Acupuncture and gastric electrical stimulation can be attempted. In severe cases,
endoscopic and surgical interventions are considered for symptom control.

The present study was undertaken to investigate the underlying mechanisms of long
noncoding RNA OIP5-AS1 via regulating miR-410 to modulate Wnt-7b in the
progression of glioma. To address this problem, we measured the expression of
OIP5-AS1 and miR-410 in glioma tissues by qRT-PCR. Glioma U87 cells were
transfected with OIP5-AS1 siRNA or miR-410 inhibitors. The targeting
relationships among miR-410, OIP5-AS1 and Wnt-7b were verified by luciferase
reporter assays. Western blotting was employed to determine the expression of
Wnt-7b/β-catenin pathway-related proteins, while MTT, flow cytometry, Transwell
assays and wound-healing assays were used to measure the biological
characteristics of glioma cells. The results showed that OIP5-AS1 expression was 
higher and miR-410 was lower in glioma tissues. Luciferase reporter assays
confirmed a targeting relationship between OIP5-AS1 and miR-410, as well as
between miR-410 and Wnt-7b. Silencing OIP5-AS1 reduced cell proliferation,
invasion and migration of glioma U87 cells and led to depressed expression levels
of miR-410, Wnt-7b, p-β-catenin, GSK-3β-pS9, c-Myc and cyclin D1. Furthermore,
down-regulation of OIP5-AS1 induced G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis
of glioma cells. Inhibitors of miR-410 abolished the biological effects of
OIP5-AS1 siRNA in glioma cells. In vivo, OIP5-AS1 knockdown also inhibited tumor 
growth. Taken together, this research suggested that silencing OIP5-AS1 may
specifically block the Wnt-7b/β-catenin pathway via targeted up-regulating
miR-410, thereby inhibiting growth, invasion and migration while promoting
apoptosis in glioma cells.

infections.

Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) are DNA fibers associated with histones,
enzymes from neutrophil granules and anti-microbial peptides. NETs are released
in a process denominated NETosis, which involves sequential steps that culminate 
with the DNA extrusion. NETosis has been described as a new mechanism of innate
immunity related to defense against different pathogens. The initial studies of
NETs were carried out with bacteria and fungi, but currently a large variety of
microorganisms capable of inducing NETs have been described including protozoan
and helminth parasites. Nevertheless, we have little knowledge about how NETosis 
process is carried out in response to the parasites, and about its implication in
the resolution of this kind of disease. In the best case, the NETs entrap and
kill parasites in vitro, but in others, immobilize the parasites without
affecting their viability. Moreover, insufficient studies on the NETs in animal
models of infections that would help to define their role, and the association of
NETs with chronic inflammatory pathologies such as those occurring in several
parasitic infections have left open the possibility of NETs contributing to
pathology instead of protection. In this review, we focus on the reported
mechanisms that lead to NET release by protozoan and helminth parasites and the
evidence that support the role of NETosis in the resolution or pathogenesis of
parasitic diseases.

The aim of the present study was to understand the possible role of the
Dihydromyricetin (DHM) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) rat model through regulation
of the AMPK/SIRT1 signaling pathway. Rats were divided into Sham group, AD group,
AD + DHM (100 mg/kg) group and AD + DHM (200 mg/kg) group. The spatial learning
and memory abilities of rats were assessed by Morris Water Maze. Then, the
inflammatory cytokines expressions were determined by radioimmunoassay while
expressions of AMPK/SIRT1 pathway-related proteins by Western blot; and the
apoptosis of hippocampal cells was detected by TdT-mediated dUTP nick end
labeling assay. AD rats had an extended escape latency with decreases in the
number of platform crossings, the target quadrant residence time, as well as
swimming speed, and the inflammatory cytokines in serum and hippocampus were
significantly elevated but AMPK/SIRT1 pathway-related proteins were reduced.
Meanwhile, the apoptosis of hippocampal cells was significantly up-regulated with
decreased Bcl-2 and increased Bax, as compared with Sham rats (all P<0.05). After
AD rats treated with 100 or 200 mg/kg of DHM, the above effects were
significantly reversed, resulting in a completely opposite tendency, and
especially with 200 mg/kg DHM treatment, the improvement of AD rats was more
obvious. DHM exerts protective role in AD via up-regulation of AMPK/SIRT1 pathway
to inhibit inflammatory responses and hippocampal cell apoptosis and ameliorate
cognitive function.

Intratumoral hypoxia is a well-known feature of solid cancers and constitutes a
major contributor to cancer metastasis and poor outcomes including melanoma.
Leucine-rich repeats and Ig-like domains 1 (LRIG1) participate in the aggressive 
progression of several tumors, where its expression is frequently decreased. In
the present study, hypoxia exposure aggravated melanoma cell invasion, migration,
vasculogenic mimicry (VM), and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). During
this process, LRIG1 expression was also decreased. Importantly, overexpression of
LRIG1 notably counteracted hypoxia-induced invasion, migration, and VM, which was
further augmented after LRIG1 inhibition. Mechanism analysis corroborated that
LRIG1 elevation muted hypoxia-induced EMT by suppressing E-cadherin expression
and increasing N-cadherin expression. Conversely, cessation of LRIG1 further
potentiated hypoxia-triggered EMT. Additionally, hypoxia stimulation activated
the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/ERK pathway, which was dampened by
LRIG1 up-regulation but further activated by LRIG1 inhibition. More important,
blocking this pathway with its antagonist erlotinib abrogated LRIG1
suppression-induced EMT, and subsequently cell invasion, migration, and VM of
melanoma cells under hypoxia. Together, these findings suggest that LRIG1
overexpression can antagonize hypoxia-evoked aggressive metastatic phenotype by
suppressing cell invasion, migration, and VM via regulating EGFR/ERK-mediated EMT
process. Therefore, these findings may provide a promising target for melanoma
therapy.

Background: Inhibitory κB kinases (IKKs) play a key role in modulating
proinflammatory and growth stimulating signals through their regulation of the
nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) cascade. Therefore, the level of expression of IKKs
represents a viable prognostic predictor with regard to various pathological
processes. The prognostic value of IKKs expression in gastric cancer remains
unclear. Methods: We used the 'Kaplan-Meier plotter' (KM plotter) online
database, to explore the predictive prognostic value of individual IKKs members' 
mRNA expression to overall survival (OS) in different clinical data including
pathological staging, histology, and therapies employed. Results: Our results
revealed that a higher mRNA expression of inhibitor of NF-κB kinase subunit α
(IKKα) was correlated to better OS, whereas higher mRNA expression of IKKβ,
inhibitor of NF-κB kinase subunit γ (IKKγ), inhibitor of NF-κB kinase subunit ε
(IKKε), and suppressor of IKKε (SIKE) were generally correlated to unfavorable OS
in gastric cancer. Increased mRNA expression of IKKε also showed better outcomes 
in stage IV gastric cancer. Further a correlation between elevated levels of mRNA
expression of both IKKε and SIKE was found to have favorable OS in diffuse type
gastric cancer. It was also revealed that high expression of SIKE had favorable
OS when treated with other adjuvant therapies, while worse OS when treated only
with 5FU therapy. Conclusion: Our results suggest that mRNA expression of
individual IKKs and SIKE are associated with unique prognostic significance and
may act as valuable prognostic biomarkers and potential targets for future
therapeutic interventions in gastric cancer.

Astroviruses are widely detected in pigs but their detection in wild boars is
rather sporadic. In this study, astroviruses were detected in organ homogenates
of wild boars by applying nested reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction,
and the typing was carried out by phylogenetic analysis. Overall, 30/200 (15.0%) 
homogenates were positive for astroviruses. Genetic typing revealed that of 13
amplicons analyzed, 8 were typed as porcine astrovirus lineage 2 (PAstV-2), 2 as 
lineage 4 (PAstV-4), 2 identical sequences were grouped with chicken astrovirus, 
and 1 sequence belonged to a bat astrovirus lineage. This first identification of
chicken and bat astroviruses in wild boars indicates interspecies transmission.

The objective of this study was to examine effects of spontaneous adipocyte
generation on osteogenic differentiation of porcine skin-derived stem cells
(pSSCs). Correlation between osteogenic differentiation and adipocyte
differentiation induced by osteocyte induction culture was determined using
different cell lines. Osteogenic differentiation efficiency of pSSCs was then
analyzed by controlling the expression of adipocyte-specific transcription
factors during osteogenic induction culture. Among four cell lines, pSSCs-II had 
the lowest lipid droplet level but the highest calcium content (p ＜ 0.05). It
also expressed significantly low levels of peroxisome proliferator-activated
receptor gamma 2 (PPARγ2) and adipocyte protein 2 (aP2) mRNAs but very high
levels of runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2) and alkaline phosphatase
(ALP) mRNAs as osteogenic makers (p ＜ 0.05). Oil red O extraction was increased
by 0.1 µM troglitazone (TGZ) treatment but decreased by 50 µM bisphenol A
diglycidyl ether (BADGE) (p ＜ 0.05). Calcium content was drastically increased
after BADGE treatment compared to that in osteogenic induction control and
TGZ-treated pSSCs (p ＜ 0.05). Relative expression levels of PPARγ2 and aP2 mRNAs 
were increased by TGZ but decreased by BADGE. Expression levels of Rucx2 and ALP 
mRNAs, osteoblast-specific marker genes, were significantly increased by BADGE
treatment (p ＜ 0.05). The expression level of BCL2 like 1 was significantly
higher in BADGE-treated pSSCs than that in TGZ-treated ones (p ＜ 0.05). The
results demonstrate that spontaneous adipocyte generation does not adversely
affect osteogenic differentiation. However, reducing spontaneous adipocyte
generation by inhibiting PPARγ2 mRNA expression can enhance in vitro osteogenic
differentiation of pSSCs.

The objective of this study was to analyze the protective effects of iodixanol on
dog spermatozoa during cryopreservation. The optimal concentration of iodixanol, 
1.5%, was determined using fresh spermatozoa and was applied in the following
experiments. The 1.5% iodixanol group showed significantly increased sperm
motility from that in the control (p ＜ 0.05). Lower mitochondrial reactive oxygen
species (ROS) modulator (ROMO1) and pro-apoptotic gene (BAX) expressions,
together with higher expressions of protamine-2 (PRM2), protamine-3 (PRM3),
anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL2), and sperm acrosome associated-3 (SPACA3)
genes were detected in the iodixanol-treated group. In addition, decreased
protamine deficiency and cryocapacitation were observed in the treatment group.
Our results show that supplementation with 1.5% iodixanol is ideal for reducing
production of ROS and preventing detrimental effects during the canine sperm
cryopreservation process, effects manifested as increased motility and reduced
cryocapacitation in frozen-thawed spermatozoa.

Sequence type (ST) 33 of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) strain
O91:H14 has been proposed as a potential domestic clone of STEC in Korea because 
of its high prevalence among human patients with mild diarrhea or asymptomatic
carriers. Herein, the clonal diversity of 17 STEC O91:H14 isolates of ST33 during
2003 to 2014 was analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, including 14
isolates from human patients and 3 from retail meats. Their virulence
characteristics, acid resistance, and antimicrobial susceptibility were also
determined. Our results showed that all isolates were clustered mainly into three
different pulsotypes and were likely low pathogenic without antimicrobial
resistance.

An 8-year-old Shih Tzu, a 5-year-old Maltese, and a 10-year-old Maltese presented
with conjunctival hyperemia and peripheral corneal edema. Severe conjunctival
thickening with varying degrees of corneal extension was observed. Cytological
examination showed many large lymphocytes with malignant changes in the
conjunctiva which was consistent with findings in fine-needle aspiration samples 
taken from regional lymph nodes. They were diagnosed as having Stage V
multicentric lymphoma. When conjunctival thickening is observed in canine
patients with multicentric lymphoma, conjunctival metastasis with infiltration of
neoplastic lymphoid cells should be included in the differential diagnosis.

In vitro prediction of hepatotoxicity can enhance the performance of non-clinical
animal testing for identifying chemical hazards. In this study, we assessed
high-content analysis (HCA) using multi-parameter cell-based assays as an in
vitro hepatotoxicity testing model using various hepatotoxicants and human
hepatocytes such as HepG2 cells and human primary hepatocytes (hPHs). Both
hepatocyte types were exposed separately to multiple doses of ten hepatotoxicants
associated with liver injury whose mechanisms of action have been described. HCA 
data were obtained using fluorescence probes for nuclear size (Hoechst),
mitochondrial membrane potential (TMRM), cytosolic free calcium (Fluo-4AM), and
lipid peroxidation (BODIPY). Cellular alterations were observed in response to
all hepatotoxicants tested. The most sensitive parameter was TMRM, with high
sensitivity at a low dose, next was BODIPY, followed by Fluo-4AM. HCA data from
HepG2 cells and hPHs were generally concordant, although some inconsistencies
were noted. Both hepatocyte types showed mild or severe mitochondrial impairment 
and lipid peroxidation in response to several hepatotoxicants. The results
demonstrate that the application of HCA to in vitro hepatotoxicity testing
enables more efficient hazard identification, and further, they suggest that
certain parameters could serve as sensitive endpoints for predicting the
hepatotoxic potential of chemical compounds.

To diagnose colibacillosis, detection of O-serogroups and virulence genes has
been recommended worldwide. The prevalence of virulence factors can fluctuate
over time. The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence of
O-serogroups, virulence genes, and F18 subtypes among pathogenic Escherichia coli
isolated from weaned piglets with diarrhea in Korea. Between 2008 and 2016, 362
E. coli were isolated from weaned piglets with diarrhea. Hemolysis was determined
in blood agar, and O-serogroups were identified using the slide agglutination
technique. The genes for the toxins and fimbriae were amplified by polymerase
chain reaction (PCR). Real-time PCR was conducted to discriminate between F18
subtypes. Although the most prevalent serogroup was O149 (11.3%) in the last 9
years, O139 (19.1%) became the most prevalent in recent years (2015-2016). The
most predominant pathotype was enterotoxigenic E. coli (61.3%). The frequencies
of Shiga-like toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) (23.4%), O139 (19.1%), Stx2e
(35.1%), and F18ab (48.7%) increased over the most recent years. Although
enterotoxigenic E. coli was the most predominant pathotype, the frequencies of
O139, Stx2e, STEC, and F18ab have increased in recent years. These results
demonstrate that there have been temporal changes in the predominant O-serogroups
and virulence genes over the last decade in Korea. These findings can be
practicable for use in epidemiology and control measures for enteric
colibacillosis in Korean piggeries.

canine MDR1 genotypes and association between genotypes and chemotherapy side
effects.

Canine MDR1 gene mutations produce translated P-glycoprotein, an active drug
efflux transporter, resulting in dysfunction or over-expression. The 4-base
deletion at exon 4 of MDR1 at nucleotide position 230 (nt230[del4]) in exon 4
makes P-glycoprotein lose function, leading to drug accumulation and toxicity.
The G allele of the c.-6-180T＞G variation in intron 1 of MDR1 (single nucleotide 
polymorphism [SNP] 180) causes P-glycoprotein over-expression, making epileptic
dogs resistant to phenobarbital treatment. Both of these mutations are reported
to be common in collies. This study develops a more efficient method to detect
these two mutations simultaneously, and clarifies the genotype association with
the side effects of chemotherapy. Genotype distribution in Taiwan was also
investigated. An oligonucleotide microarray was successfully developed for the
detection of both genotypes and was applied to clinical samples. No 4-base
deletion mutant allele was detected in dogs in Taiwan. However, the G allele
variation of SNP 180 was spread across all dog breeds, not only in collies. The
chemotherapy adverse effect percentages of the SNP 180 T/T, T/G, and G/G
genotypes were 16.7%, 6.3%, and 0%, respectively. This study describes an
efficient way for MDR1 gene mutation detection, clarifying genotype distribution,
and the association with chemotherapy.

Somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT) has various applications in research, as
well as in the medical field and animal husbandry. However, the efficiency of
SCNT is low and the accurate mechanism of SCNT in murine embryo development is
unreported. In general, the developmental rate of SCNT murine embryos is lower
than in vivo counterparts. In previous studies, polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) was
reported to be a crucial element in cell division including centrosome
maturation, cytokinesis, and spindle formation. In an initial series of
experiments in this study, BI2536, a Plk1 inhibitor, was treated to in
vivo-fertilized embryos and the embryos failed to develop beyond the 2-cell
stage. This confirmed previous findings that Plk1 is crucial for the first
mitotic division of murine embryos. Next, we investigated Plk1's localization and
intensity by immunofluorescence analysis. In contrast to normally developed
embryos, SCNT murine embryos that failed to develop exhibited two types of Plk1
expressions; a low Plk1 expression pattern and ectopic expression of Plk1. The
results show that Plk1 has a critical role in SCNT murine embryos. In conclusion,
this study demonstrated that the SCNT murine embryos fail to develop beyond the
2-cell stage, and the embryos show abnormal Plk1 expression patterns, which may
one of the main causes of developmental failure of early SCNT murine embryos.

Monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) are widely applied in disease diagnoses. Herein, we 
report a MAb, WF-4, against Influenza A virus nucleoprotein (NP), its broad
response with Influenza A virus, and its application in an immunohistochemistry
(IHC) assay. WF-4 was screened by immunofluorescence assay (IFA). The results
showed that its reactivity with baculovirus-expressed full-length recombinant NP 
(rNP) in Western blot (WB), indicating its IHC applicability. Fifteen Influenza A
virus (reference subtypes H1 to H15) infected chicken embryonated chorioallantoic
membranes (CAM), fixed by formalin, were all detectable in the WF-4-based IHC
assay. Also, the reactivity of the IHC test with NP from experimentally
inoculated H6N1 and from all recent outbreaks of H5 subtype avian Influenza A
virus (AIV) field cases in Taiwan showed positive results. Our data indicate that
CAM, a by-product of Influenza A virus preparation, is helpful for Influenza A
virus-specific MAb characterization, and that the WF-4 MAb recognizes conserved
and linear epitopes of Influenza A virus NP. Therefore, WF-4 is capable of
detecting NP antigens via IHC and may be suitable for developing various tests
for diagnosis of Influenza A virus and, especially, AIV infection.

University, Seoul 06974, Republic of Korea.

Neural stem cells (NSCs) can proliferate and differentiate into multiple cell
types that constitute the nervous system. NSCs can be derived from developing
fetuses, embryonic stem cells, or induced pluripotent stem cells. NSCs provide a 
good platform to screen drugs for neurodegenerative diseases and also have
potential applications in regenerative medicine. Natural products have long been 
used as compounds to develop new drugs. In this review, natural products that
control NSC fate and induce their differentiation into neurons or glia are
discussed. These phytochemicals enable promising advances to be made in the
treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.

Oxidative stress is considered a major contributor in the pathogenesis of
diabetic neuropathy and in diabetes complications, such as nephropathy and
cardiovascular diseases. Diabetic neuropathy, which is the most frequent
complications of diabetes, affect sensory, motor, and autonomic nerves. This
study aimed to investigate whether 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF) protects
SH-SY5Y neuronal cells against high glucose-induced toxicity. In the current
study, we found that diabetic patients exhibited higher lipid peroxidation caused
by oxidative stress than healthy subjects. 7,8-DHF exhibits superoxide anion and 
hydroxyl radical scavenging activities. High glucose-induced toxicity severely
damaged SH-SY5Y neuronal cells, causing mitochondrial depolarization; however,
7,8-DHF recovered mitochondrial polarization. Furthermore, 7,8-DHF effectively
modulated the expression of pro-apoptotic protein (Bax) and anti-apoptotic
protein (Bcl-2) under high glucose, thus inhibiting the activation of caspase
signaling pathways. These results indicate that 7,8-DHF has antioxidant effects
and protects cells from apoptotic cell death induced by high glucose. Thus,
7,8-DHF may be developed into a promising candidate for the treatment of diabetic
neuropathy.

The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of tissue inhibitor of
metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1) on the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation 
potential of human bone marrow-derived MSCs (hBMSCs). hBMSCs with stable TIMP-1
overexpression or TIMP-1 knockdown were generated. Osteogenic differentiation was
assessed by Alizarin Red S staining, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and
expression of specific markers. Compared with the vehicle controls, TIMP-1
knockdown significantly promoted the growth of hBMSCs. TIMP-1 knockdown
up-regulated β-catenin and cyclin D1 proteins. During osteogenic differentiation,
TIMP-1 knockdown elevated the deposition of calcium nodules, ALP activity and the
mRNA levels of the osteogenic markers sex determining region Y-box 9 (Sox9),
CCAAT-enhancer-binding protein and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ. 
During osteogenic differentiation, TIMP-1 knockdown significantly enhanced the
up-regulation of osteocalcin proteins. Meanwhile, TIMP-1 overexpression
attenuated the Wnt/activator Wnt3a-induced up-regulation cyclin D1 and
Runt-related transcription factor 2 (RUNX-2) (during osteogenic differentiation) 
proteins, while TIMP-1 knockdown restored the inhibitor Dickkopf 1-induced
inhibition effect on the expression of β-catenin, cyclin D1 and RUNX-2. TIMP-1
plays a negative regulatory role in the proliferation and osteogenesis of hBMSCs,
at least partially, through Wnt/β-catenin signaling.

Conventional antidepressants have a disadvantage in delayed onset of efficacy.
Here, we aimed to evaluate the immediate and persistent antidepressant-like
action of a classic herbal medicine Chaihu-jia-Longgu-Muli decoction (CLM) as
well as the action of CLM on hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
over time. CLM consists of Xiaochaihu decoction (XchD), Longgu-Muli (LM) and
several other herbs. The contribution of constituent herbal formula XchD and
other parts of CLM was also assessed. Following a single dose of CLM, tail
suspension test (TST), forced swim test (FST), and novelty-suppressed feeding
test (NSF) were performed. The antidepressant activity of XchD, its interaction
with LM or remaining parts of CLM was also examined after a single
administration. BDNF expression in the hippocampus was examined at 30 min and 24 
hr post a single CLM. A single administration of half of clinical dose of CLM
elicited antidepressant effects at TST 30 min post administration, and lasted for
72 hr. Furthermore, CLM also reduced the latency to eat in NSF test. A single
proportional dose of XchD induced antidepressant effects at 30 min and lasted for
48 hr, whereas the effect lasted for 72 hr when combined with either LM or the
remaining parts of CLM. BDNF expression increased at 30 min and persisted at
least for 24 hr after a single dose of CLM. The results support that
Chaihu-jia-Longgu-Muli decoction was capable to immediately and enduringly elicit
antidepressant activity via enhancement of hippocampal BDNF expression, in which 
the constituent Xiaochaihu decoction played the primary role.

BACKGROUND: Osteosarcoma (OS) is the most common malignant neoplasm in children
and adolescents with a very high propensity for local invasion and poor response 
to current therapy. Anti-cancer effect of chamaejasmine is newly discovered from 
Stellera chamaejasmine L. Our study focuses on investigating the effect of
chamaejasmine on the cellular apoptosis, proliferation, autophagy, and the
underlying mechanisms in MG-63.
METHODS: Our study investigated the concentration of chamaejasmine in MG-63 cells
by MTT and verified that chamaejasmine inhibited cell invasion by transwell. We
also used Hoechst staining as well as apoptotic associated-proteins in MG-63
cells. Meanwhile, we also detected the lysophagesome and autophagsome by
Lysotracker. Adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK)
knockdown was performed with siRNA.
RESULTS: Our results show that chamaejasmine exerts cellular growth inhibition,
pro-apoptotic and pro-autophagic effect via activating AMPK in MG-63 cells.
Furthermore, chamaejasmine significantly increases autophagic cell via the
inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and activation of AMPK
signaling pathways. Administrated with chamaejasmine also induces reactive oxygen
species (ROS) generation, indicating cross-talking between these two primary
modes of programmed cell death.
CONCLUSION: Our results show that chamaejasmine promotes apoptosis and autophagy 
by activating AMPK/mTOR signaling pathways with involvement of ROS in MG-63
cells. Chamaejasmine is a promising anti-cancer agent in OS treatment, and
further studies are needed to confirm its efficacy and safety in vivo or other
cancer cells.

Large doses of flavonoids could cure many diseases with no serious side effects. 
However, the role of flavonoids in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome
(PCOS) has not been reported. Therefore, total flavonoids extracted from Nervilia
Fordii were selected to explore its therapeutic efficiency in PCOS. PCOS rat
model was constructed to explore the role of total flavonoids in the treatment of
PCOS. ELISA was used to assess the changes of ovulation function under the
treatment of total flavonoids with or without exogenous interleukin-6 (IL-6).
Western blot, real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry were carried out to assess
the related molecular mechanisms. We explored that total flavonoids obviously
increased the serum levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and sharply
decreased the serum levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), testosterone (T) and
insulin (INS) in the PCOS-IR rats via partly inhibiting the activation of
JAK2/STAT3 pathway, partially up-regulating the IL-6 expression and partially
down-regulating the suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) expression in
ovaries of PCOS rats. The effect of total flavonoids on estrous cycles, serum
levels of FSH, LH, T and INS were partially attenuated by IL-6 in PCOS rat model.
Moreover, IL-6 significantly reversed the effect of total flavonoids on the
phosphorylation of JAK2/STAT3, the expression of IL-6 and SOCS3 in ovaries of
PCOS rats. Total flavonoids extracted from Nervilia Fordii might induce the
expression of IL-6 in ovary and act as a potential therapeutic drug for the
treatment of PCOS.

Some medicinal herbs and compounds are known to target cancer cells, but the
success of them as anticancer compounds depends to a large extent on their
ability to activate pathways that kill cancer cells by arresting cell cycle and
inducing apoptosis. The aim of the present study was to determine the anticancer 
effects of Euphorbia szovitsii Fisch. & C.A.Mey. on the breast cancer cells to
reveal the underlying mechanism of its anti-breast cancer properties. In this
experimental study, triple negative breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-231) was
cultivated in RPMI-1640 medium. Hydroalcoholic extract (70:30) of aerial parts of
the plant was prepared. The cultured cells were treated with different
concentrations (0-1000 μg/ml) of E. szovitsii extract for 24 and 48 h. Toxicity
of the extract on MDA-MB-231 cells was examined using MTT
(3-[4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl]-2, 5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) test. The
Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit was used to evaluate apoptosis and
necrosis. Flow cytometry technique was employed to differentiate different phases
of the cell cycle in the cells. Data were analyzed by GraphPad Prism and SPSS
software. After 24 and 48 h, the IC50 values were respectively 76.78 (95% CI =
60.75-97.05; R = 0.8588) and 59.71 (95% CI = 46.25-77.09; R = 0.8543) μg/ml for
E. szovitsii The extract exhibited antiproliferative effects against MDA-MB-231
cells in a dose-dependent manner. Annexin V-FITC/PI assay confirmed that the
extract was able to induce apoptosis in MDA-MB-231 cells. Moreover, treatment
with the extract resulted in cell cycle arrest at G1 phase. Therefore, E.
szovitsii could induce apoptosis and cycle arrest in the MDA-MB-231 cell line. It
might be a good resource of natural products for producing anti-breast cancer
drugs.

Cell therapeutic agents for treating degenerative brain diseases using neural
stem cells are actively being developed. However, few systems have been developed
to monitor in real time whether the transplanted neural stem cells are actually
differentiated into neurons. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a technology
capable of specifically monitoring neuronal differentiation in vivo. In this
study, we established a system that expresses cell membrane-targeting red
fluorescent protein under control of the Synapsin promoter in order to
specifically monitor differentiation from neural stem cells into neurons. In
order to overcome the weak expression level of the tissue-specific promoter
system, the partial 5' UTR sequence of Creb was added for efficient expression of
the cell surface-specific antigen. This system was able to track functional
neuronal differentiation of neural stem cells transplanted in vivo, which will
help improve stem cell therapies.

OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of single-nucleotide polymorphisms of the OPRM1
and ABCB1 genes on the analgesic effect and consumption of sufentanil after
thoracoscopic-assisted radical resection of lung cancer.
METHODS: A total of 225 Chinese Han nationality patients undergoing
thoracoscopic-assisted radical resection of lung cancer were enrolled in the
present study. Among them, 132 were males (58.67%) and 93 (41.33%) were females
having American Society of Anesthesiologists statuses classified as grades I or
II. The rs1799971, rs563649 and rs1323040 genotypes of the OPRM1 gene and
rs2032582, rs1045642 and rs1128503 genotypes of the ABCB1 gene were detected by
Sanger sequencing. The state anxiety index and pressure pain threshold were
assessed preoperatively. Sufentanil was administered intravenously to maintain
anesthesia. The doses and side effects of sufentanil consumed 6 h (T1), 24 h (T2)
and 48 h (T3) after surgery were recorded.
RESULTS: The sufentanil doses at T1, T2 and T3 were significantly higher in
radical-operation lung cancer patients with mutant homozygous rs1799971 and
rs1323040 loci in the OPRM1 gene and rs2032582 and rs1128503 loci in the ABCB1
gene. The doses of sufentanil consumed by mutant heterozygous lung cancer
patients at T1, T2 and T3 were significantly higher than those consumed by
patients without mutations, and the differences were statistically significant
(P<0.05). There was no significant difference in sufentanil doses consumed by
lung cancer patients with mutant homozygous, mutant heterozygous and wild-type
rs563649 locus of the OPRM1 gene and rs1045642 locus of the ABCB1 gene at T1, T2 
and T3 (P>0.05). There was no significant difference in the visual analog scale
scores at T1, T2 and T3 for different genotypes of OPRM1 and ABCB1 genes in lung 
cancer patients (P>0.05). No significant difference was found between the adverse
reactions of OPRM1 and ABCB1 genotypes in patients undergoing radical resection
of lung cancer (P>0.05).
CONCLUSION: The rs1799971 and rs1323040 polymorphisms of the OPRM1 gene and
rs2032582 and rs1128503 polymorphisms of the ABCB1 gene are related to the
analgesic effect and consumed dose of sufentanil in Chinese Han patients
undergoing radical operation of lung cancer.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the most fatal types of cancer with 
significant mortality and morbidity worldwide. MicroRNAs (miRs) have been
confirmed to have positive functions in NSCLC. In the present study, we try to
explore the role of miR-758 in proliferation, migration, invasion, and apoptosis 
of NSCLC cells by regulating high-mobility group box (HMGB) 3 (HMGB3.) NSCLC and 
adjacent tissues were collected. Reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)
was employed to detect expression of miR-758 and HMGB3 in NSCLC and adjacent
tissues, in BEAS-2B cells and NSCLC cell lines. The targetted relationship
between miR-758 and HMGB3 was identified by dual luciferase reporter gene assay. 
The effects of miR-758 on proliferation, migration, invasion, cell cycle, and
apoptosis of A549 cells. MiR-758 expression was lower in NSCLC tissues, which was
opposite to HMGB3 expression. The results also demonstrated that miR-758 can
target HMGB3. The cells transfected with miR-758 mimic had decreased HMGB3
expression, proliferation, migration, and invasion, with more arrested cells in
G1 phase and increased apoptosis. Our results supported that the overexpression
of miR-758 inhibits proliferation, migration, and invasion, and promotes
apoptosis of NSCLC cells by negative regulating HMGB2. The present study may
provide a novel target for NSCLC treatment.

Background: Acute liver failure (ALF) is a disease of acute derangements in the
hepatic synthetic function with defects involving innate immune responses, which 
was reported to be negatively regulated by tumor necrosis factor α-induced
protein 3 (A20). Herein, the present study was conducted to investigate the
effects the A20 protein on the proliferation and apoptosis of hepatocytes through
the nuclear factor (NF)-κB signaling pathway in the rat models simulating
ALF.Methods: Male Wistar rats were used to simulate ALF in the model rats. Next, 
the positive expression of A20 and Caspase-3 proteins was measured in liver
tissues. Rat hepatocytes were separated and subjected to pyrrolidine
dithiocarbamate (PDTC, inhibitor of NF-κB pathway) or A20 siRNA. Additionally,
both mRNA and protein levels of A20, NF-κB, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)
receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), and receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1)
were determined. Finally, we detected the hepatocyte proliferation, cell cycle
entry, and apoptosis.Results: ALF rats displayed a lower positive expression of
A20 protein and a higher expression of Caspase-3 protein. Furthermore, A20 was
down-regulated, while NF-κB, TRAF6, and RIP1 were all up-regulated in ALF rats.
Notably, A20 inhibited activation of NF-κB signaling pathway. The blockade of
NF-κB signaling pathway enhanced proliferation and cell cycle progression of
hepatocytes, whereas inhibited apoptosis of hepatocytes. On the contrary, A20
siRNA reversed the above situation.Conclusion: A20 inhibits apoptosis of
hepatocytes and promotes the proliferation through the NF-κB signaling pathway in
ALF rats, potentially providing new insight into the treatment of ALF.

Objective: The aim of the present study is to investigate the association between
the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) sites of peroxisome
proliferator-activated receptor Δ (PPARD) and the risk of coronary artery disease
(CAD). To this end, a prospective observational single-center study of the
clinical data from 880 subjects in a Chinese population was conducted. Methods: A
total of 880 subjects, including 609 CAD patients and 271 control subjects, were 
selected for the present study. All inpatients had 4 ml of venous blood drawn
after 12 h of fasting, and then clinical tests were conducted to obtain the
biochemical parameters. CAD patients and Controls were distinguished by coronary 
angiography. Statistical analysis was conducted with SPSS software (ver 16.0).
Results: A significant association between the G-alleles of PPARD rs3777744 and
rs3798343 and a decreased risk for CAD was found. Moreover, we found an
interaction between high fasting high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C)
serum levels, low serum glucose levels and their genotypes, ultimately decreasing
the risk of CAD. Haplotype analysis was conducted on the three SNP sites,
rs3777744 and rs3798343 to form a block [r2 = 0.79, D' = 0.99). The A-C
haplotypes were associated with an increased risk of CAD (odds ratio (OR), 95%
confidence interval (CI): 1.321 (1.060-1.647), P=0.013], and the G-G haplotypes
were associated with a decreased risk [OR, 95% CI: 0.714 (0.567-0.849), P=0.004].
Conclusions: Our study indicates a significant association between the G-alleles 
of PPARD rs3777744 and rs3798343 and a decreased CAD risk. In addition, genotypes
interact with high serum HDL-C levels and low serum glucose levels, resulting in 
decreased prevalence of CAD.

Amoebiasis caused by the protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica remains a
public health problem in developing countries, making the identification of new
anti-amoebic compounds a continuing priority. Previously, we have shown that
lactoferrin (Lf) and several Lf-derived peptides exhibit in vitro anti-amoebic
activity independently of their iron-binding activity. Here, we evaluated the
amoebicidal effect of synthetic Lf-derived peptides Lfcin-B, Lfcin 17-30, and
Lfampin, analyzed the mechanism of death induced by the peptides and determined
their therapeutic effects on murine intestinal amoebiasis. MTT assays in
trophozoite cultures of E. histolytica exposed to each peptide (1-1000 μM) showed
that Lfampin is far more amoebicidal than Lfcins. Lfampin killed 80% of
trophozoites at doses higher than 100 μM in 24 h, and FACs analysis using Annexin
V/propidium iodide showed that death occurred mainly by necrosis. In contrast,
Lfcin-B and Lfcin 17-30 appeared to have no significant effect on amoebic
viability. FACs and confocal microscopy analysis using FITC-labeled peptides
showed that all three peptides are internalized by the amoeba mainly using
receptor (PI3K signaling) and actin-dependent pathways but independent of
clathrin. Docking studies identified cholesterol in the amoeba's plasma membrane 
as a possible target of Lfampin. Oral treatment of intracecally infected mice
with the abovementioned peptides at 10 mg/kg for 4 days showed that Lfampin
resolved 100% of the cases of intestinal amoebiasis, whereas Lfcin 17-30 and
Lfcin-B were effective in resolving infection in 80 and 70% of cases,
respectively. These data show that although synthetic bovine Lf-derived peptides 
exhibit varying amoebicidal potentials in vitro, they do resolve murine
intestinal amoebiasis efficiently, suggesting that they may be useful as a
therapeutic treatment.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential role of GAS8
antisense RNA 1 (GAS8-AS1) in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC).
PcDNA3.1-GAS8-AS1 and si-GAS8-AS1, miR-135b-5p mimic and si-CCND2 were
transfected into PTC cells. Cell proliferation was evaluated by Cell Counting
Kit-8 (CCK-8). QRT-PCR was used to determine expressions of GAS8-AS1,
miR-135b-5p, and CCND2, and Western blot were detected protein level of CCND2.
The miRNA target gene prediction site TargetScan was used to predict potential
targets of GAS8-AS1 and miR-135b-5p. Cell cycle progression was analyzed by flow 
cytometry. We found that GAS8-AS1 was down-regulated in PTC cell lines and
inhibited proliferation and cycle of PTC cell. GAS8-AS1 directly targets
miR-135b-5p, and GAS8-AS1 could regulate a downstream target of miR-135b-5p,
Cyclin G2 (CCNG2), in an miR-135b-5p-mediated manner. In addition, we also proved
that overexpressed GAS8-AS1 inhibited tumor formation in vivo GAS8-AS1 suppresses
PTC cell growth through the miR-135b-5p/CCND2 axis.

Complex plant tissues vary in hardness, i.e. some are succulent, while others are
complex to break. Besides, plant metabolites, such as polysaccharides, proteins, 
polyphenols and lipids, can greatly interfere with the RNA extraction. So, in
order to obtain a high-quality RNA from the complex tissues (like coconut
endosperm, coconut apple and coconut leaf bud) rich in secondary metabolites, a
robust method is demanded. Several methods (MRIP, CTAB and TRIZOL) have been used
previously for the isolation of quality RNA from the coconut tissues, but without
any success. The present study will provide with the details of a new method
(Quick and Reliable RNA Extraction Method or QRREM), which have efficiently
isolated the intact RNA form the complex tissues of coconut compared with CTAB,
Trizol and RNA plant. The method has been validated for the isolation of
high-quality intact RNA from the other available plant species (Areca/betel nut, 
mint and spring onion). The method has various advantages over the other methods 
in terms of time and cost effectiveness. Furthermore, the resulted RNA from
various tissues of coconut performed well in the downstream experiments, i.e.
reverse transcription and PCR for the production and amplification of cDNA.

The present study investigated the effects of Colchicine on gastric carcinoma
(GC) cells and explored its possible mechanisms underlying such effects. The
results of MTT and colony formation assays showed that Colchicine (2, 5, and 10
ng/ml) markedly inhibited the proliferation of AGS and NCI-N87 cells in a
dose-dependent manner. It also led to a reduction in cell migration in both GC
cells as determined by Transwell migration assay. Mover, data form Hoechst 33342 
staining and flow cytometry assay indicated that Colchicine (2, 5, and 10 ng/ml) 
promoted the apoptosis of NCI-N87 cells. In addition, the release of cytochrome
c, the activation of bax, and the inhibition of bcl-2 were observed in NCI-N87
cells treated with Colchicine. Furthermore, the in vivo experiment further
confirmed that Colchicine administration remarkably suppressed the tumor growth
in nude mice via induction of apoptosis at 0.05 and 0.1 mg/kg. In addition, no
visible toxicity was observed in liver and renal tissue of mice. This finding
suggests that Colchicine-induced apoptosis is associated with caspase-3-mediated 
mitochondrial apoptotic pathways.

BACKGROUND: This research aimed to study the associations between XPD (G751A,
rs13181), hOGG1 (C326G, rs1052133) and XRCC4 (G1394T, rs6869366) gene
polymorphisms and the risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) in a Chinese Han
population.
METHOD: A total of 225 Chinese Han patients with CRC were selected as the study
group, and 200 healthy subjects were recruited as the control group. The
polymorphisms of XPD G751A, hOGG1 C326G and XRCC4 G1394T loci were detected by
the RFLP-PCR technique in the peripheral blood of all subjects.
RESULTS: Compared with individuals carrying the XPD751 GG allele, the A allele
carriers (GA/AA) had a significantly increased risk of CRC (adjusted OR = 2.109, 
95%CI = 1.352-3.287, P=0.003). Similarly, the G allele (CG/GG) of hOGG1 C326G
locus conferred increased susceptibility to CRC (adjusted OR = 2.654, 95%CI =
1.915-3.685, P<0.001). In addition, the T allele carriers (GT/TT) of the XRCC4
G1394T locus have an increased risk of developing CRC (adjusted OR = 4.512, 95%CI
= 2.785-7.402, P<0.001). The risk of CRC was significantly increased in
individuals with both the XPD locus A allele and the hOGG1 locus G allele
(adjusted OR = 1.543, 95%CI = 1.302-2.542, P=0.002). Furthermore, individuals
with both the hOGG1 locus G allele and the XRCC4 locus T allele were predisposed 
to CRC development (adjusted OR = 3.854, 95%CI = 1.924-7.123, P<0.001). The risks
of CRC in XPD gene A allele carriers (GA/AA) (adjusted OR = 1.570, 95%CI =
1.201-1.976, P=0.001), hOGG1 gene G allele carriers (CG/GG) (adjusted OR = 3.031,
95%CI = 2.184-4.225, P<0.001) and XRCC4 gene T allele carriers (GT/TT) (adjusted 
OR = 2.793, 95%CI = 2.235-3.222, P<0.001) were significantly higher in patients
who smoked ≥16 packs/year.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that XPD G751A, hOGG1 C326G and XRCC4 G1394T gene
polymorphisms might play an important role in colorectal carcinogenesis and
increase the risk of developing CRC in the Chinese Han population. The
interaction between smoking and these gene polymorphisms would increase the risk 
of CRC.

Most diabetic patients experience diabetic mellitus (DM) urinary bladder
dysfunction. A number of studies evaluate bladder smooth muscle contraction in
DM. In this study, we evaluated the change of bladder smooth muscle contraction
between normal rats and DM rats. Furthermore, we used pharmacological inhibitors 
to determine the differences in the signaling pathways between normal and DM
rats. Rats in the DM group received an intraperitoneal injection of 65 mg/kg
streptozotocin and measured blood glucose level after 14 days to confirm DM.
Bladder smooth muscle contraction was induced using acetylcholine (ACh, 10⁻⁴ M). 
The materials such as, atropine (a muscarinic receptor antagonist), U73122 (a
phospholipase C inhibitor), DPCPX (an adenosine A₁ receptor antagonist), udenafil
(a PDE5 inhibitor), prazosin (an α₁-receptor antagonist), papaverine (a smooth
muscle relaxant), verapamil (a calcium channel blocker), and chelerythrine (a
protein kinase C inhibitor) were pre-treated in bladder smooth muscle. We found
that the DM rats had lower bladder smooth muscle contractility than normal rats. 
When prazosin, udenafil, verapamil, and U73122 were pre-treated, there were
significant differences between normal and DM rats. Taken together, it was
concluded that the change of intracellular Ca²⁺ release mediated by PLC/IP3 and
PDE5 activity were responsible for decreased bladder smooth muscle contractility 
in DM rats.

Ginger, one of worldwide consumed dietary spice, is not only famous as food
supplements, but also believed to exert a variety of remarkable pharmacological
activity as herbal remedies. In this study, a ginger constituent,
12-dehydrogingerdione (DHGD) was proven that has comparable anti-inflammatory
activity with positive control 6-shogaol in inhibiting LPS-induced interleukin
(IL)-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, prostaglandin (PG) E₂, nitric oxide (NO), 
inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, without interfering with
COX-1 in cultured microglial cells. Subsequent mechanistic studies indicate that 
12-DHGD may inhibit neuro-inflammation through suppressing the LPS-activated
Akt/IKK/NF-κB pathway. Furthermore, 12-DHGD markedly promoted the activation of
NF-E2-related factor (Nrf)-2 and heme oxygenase (HO)-1, and we demonstrated that 
the involvement of HO-1 on the production of pro-inflammatory mediators such as
NO and TNF-α by using a HO-1 inhibitor, Zinc protoporphyrin (Znpp). These results
indicate that 12-DHGD may protect against neuro-inflammation by inhibiting
Akt/IKK/IκB/NF-κB pathway and promoting Nrf-2/HO-1 pathway.

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common hematologic malignancy, 
however, specific tumor-associated genes and signaling pathways are yet to be
deciphered. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were computed based on gene
expression profiles from GSE32018, GSE56315, and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
DLBC. Overlapping DEGs were then evaluated for gene ontology (GO), pathways
enrichment, DNA methylation, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis
as well as survival analysis. Seventy-four up-regulated and 79 down-regulated
DEGs were identified. From PPI network analysis, majority of the DEGs were
involved in cell cycle, oocyte meiosis, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition 
(EMT) pathways. Six hub genes including CDC20, MELK, PBK, prostaglandin D2
synthase (PTGDS), PCNA, and CDK1 were selected using the Molecular Complex
Detection (MCODE). CDC20 and PTGDS were able to predict overall survival (OS) in 
TCGA DLBC and in an additional independent cohort GSE31312. Furthermore, CDC20
DNA methylation negatively regulated CDC20 expression and was able to predict OS 
in DLBCL. A two-gene panel consisting of CDC20 and PTGDS had a better prognostic 
value compared with CDC20 or PTGDS alone in the TCGA cohort (P=0.026 and 0.039). 
Overall, the present study identified a set of novel genes and pathways that may 
play a significant role in the initiation and progression of DLBCL. In addition, 
CDC20 and PTGDS will provide useful guidance for therapeutic applications.

Intestinal barrier dysfunction has been implicated in the development of
multiorgan dysfunction syndrome caused by the trauma-hemorrhagic shock (THS).
However, the mechanisms underlying THS-induced gut barrier injury are still
poorly understood. In the present study, we used the metabolomics analysis to
test the hypothesis that altered metabolites might be related to the development 
of THS-induced barrier dysfunction in the large intestine. Under the induction of
THS, gut barrier failure was characterized by injury of permeability and mucus
layer, which were companied by the decreased expression of zonula occludens-1 in 
the colon and increased levels of inflammatory factors including tumor necrosis
factor-α, interferon-γ, interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-1β in the serum. A total of 16
differential metabolites were identified in colonic tissues from THS-treated rats
compared with control rats. These altered metabolites included dihydroxy acetone 
phosphate, ribose-5-phosphate, fructose, glyceric acid, succinic acid, and
adenosine, which are critical intermediates or end products that are involved in 
pentose phosphate pathway, glycolysis, and tricarboxylic acid cycle as well as
mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate biosynthesis. These findings may offer
important insight into the metabolic alterations in THS-treated gut injury, which
will be helpful for developing effective metabolites-based strategies to prevent 
THS-induced gut barrier dysfunction.

Neuroblastoma is the most common tumor in children, with a very poor prognosis.
It is urgent to identify novel biomarkers to treat neuroblastoma, together with
surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. Human tripartite motif 59 (TRIM59), a
member of the TRIM family, has been reported to participate in several human
tumors. However, the exact role of TRIM59 in neuroblastoma is unknown. In the
present study, real-time PCR and Western blot were used to measure mRNA and
protein levels of TRIM59 in four neuroblastoma cell lines and in neuroblastoma
tissues. Lentiviruses targeting TRIM59 were used to up/down-regulate TRIM59
expression levels. Cell Counting Kit-8 and Annexin-V/PI were used to analyze cell
proliferation and apoptosis in neuroblastoma cell lines. Our data showed that
TRIM59 knockdown inhibits cell proliferation while inducing apoptosis in SH-SY5Y 
and SK-N-SH neuroblastoma cell lines. TRIM59 knockdown up-regulated expression of
Bax and Bim and down-regulated levels of Survivin, β-catenin, and c-myc.
Interestingly, the inhibition of cell proliferation caused by TRIM59 knockdown
could be blocked by LiCl, which is an agonist of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
In contrast, TRIM59 overexpression could increase cell proliferation, up-regulate
Survivin, β-catenin and c-myc, down-regulate Bax and Bim, and these effects could
be blocked by XAV939, which is an inhibitor of Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway.
In addition, TRIM59 was up-regulated and positively related with β-catenin in
neuroblastoma tissues. In conclusion, TRIM59 was up-regulated in neuroblastoma,
and TRIM59 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation by down-regulating the
Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in neuroblastoma.

Background: Estrogen has been suggested to play a protective role against airway 
inflammations, such as asthma. In these processes, the inflammasome
nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domain
containing 3 (NLRP3) partly accounts for the activation of pro-inflammatory
factors. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether NLRP3 was
involved in the protective effect of estrogen against allergic airway
inflammation. Methods: An ovariectomy was performed on female C57BL/6 mice; some 
were sham-operated (sham). We then sensitized and challenged them with ovalbumin 
(OVA) to establish an airway inflammation model. Meanwhile, some mice were
treated with 17β-estradiol (E2) for 28 days. Results: The expression of NLRP3
inflammasome and its downstream products, caspase-1 and the pro-inflammatory
cytokine interleukin (IL)-1β (IL-1β), increased concomitantly with OVA-challenged
airway inflammation and decreased with the expression of estrogen receptor β
(ERβ). In addition, treating ovariectomized (OVX) mice with E2 dramatically
ameliorated airway inflammation via such mechanisms as leukocyte recruitment,
mucus production, and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines other than IL-18 in
bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid (BALF). Furthermore, E2 suppressed both the
mRNA expression and protein expression of NLRP3, caspase-1, and IL-1β. In
summary, our study showed that NLRP3 inflammasome activation and pro-inflammatory
cytokine production markedly increased in OVA-induced airway inflammation, and E2
effectively abrogated such inflammation by regulating the activation of NLRP3.

The present study aims to evaluate the protective effect of grape seed
proanthocyanidins (GSP) on cadmium (Cd)-induced testicular apoptosis,
inflammation, and oxidative stress in rats. A total of 24 male Wistar rats were
divided into four groups, namely control, GSP (100 mg/kg BW), Cd (5 mg/kg BW),
and Cd+GSP. Cd-treated rat testes exhibited a significant increment in oxidative 
stress mediated inflammation and apoptosis. Pre-administration of GSP exhibit
significant protection against the apoptotic and inflammatory damages elicited by
Cd and uphold the intercellular antioxidant status in testes. Histological
changes were studied and the immunohistochemical staining for caspase 3, HSP70,
and eNOS protein expressions were also analyzed to justify the protective action 
of GSP. Furthermore, GSP prevented DNA damage, and enhanced the expression of
antioxidant responsive elements Nrf2/HO-1 by PI3K/Akt-dependent pathway.
Therefore, our results suggest that GSP acts as a multipotent antioxidant entity 
against Cd-induced oxidative testicular toxicity in rats.

(1)Department of Pathology, People's Hospital of Xintai City, Xintai City,
Shandong Province 271200, China 13954863871@163.com.

BACKGROUND: Accumulating studies discloses that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)
serve important roles in human tumorigenesis, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma 
(NPC). The purpose of the present study was to determine the role of lncRNA
FEZF1-AS1 in NPC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression levels of FEZF1-AS1 in NPC tissues and cell
lines were detected by RT-qPCR analysis. MTT assay was performed to investigate
the proliferation of NPC cells in vitro, whereas the migration and invasion of
NPC cells were determined by wound healing assay and transwell assay. A nude
mouse tumor model was established to study the role of FEZF1-AS1 in NPC
tumorigenesis in vivo The expression levels of proteins were detected by Western 
blot assay.
RESULTS: The results showed that FEZF1-AS1 expression was increased in the NPC
tissues and cell lines, and the higher expression of FEZF1-AS1 was closely
associated with poor prognosis of NPC patients. We further observed that
knockdown of FEZF1-AS1 inhibited the proliferation of NPC cells in vitro and
suppressed NPC xenograft growth in vivo through inducing G2/M cell cycle arrest. 
The migratory and invasive abilities of NPC cells were also reduced upon
FEZF1-AS1 knockdown. Moreover, we demonstrated that inhibition of FEZF1-AS1
remarkably suppressed epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and reduced
β-catenin accumulation in nucleus in NPC cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, we showed that FEZF1-AS1 might be a key regulator of
cell cycle, EMT and Wnt/β-catenin signaling in NPC cells, which may be helpful
for understanding of pathogenesis of NPC.

In consideration of its noninvasive administration and endogenous stimulation
property, the enhancement of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) via
low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) could be a novel strategy for aluminum
(Al) overload-induced cerebral damage. LIPUS was pre-treated 7 days before
concomitantly given with aluminum chloride (AlCl3) daily for a period of 42 days.
Morris water maze and elevated plus maze were performed to analyze spatial
learning and memory. Western Blot and immunoprecipitation were used to detect
BDNF and histone acetylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) and histone H4 lysine 
12 (H4K12) in the hippocampus. Assay of malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide
dismutase (SOD), glutathione (GSH), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) indicated
the extent of oxidative damages. Aluminium exposure in rats can cause attenuated 
spatial learning and memory, followed by up-regulated histone deacetylase 6
(HDAC6) expression, down-regulated H3K9 and H4K12 acetylation at the PIII and PIV
promoter of BDNF, all of which will eventually inhibit BDNF expression. LIPUS can
recover reduced cognitive function by restoring histone acetylation and BDNF
expression, accompanied with increased SOD, GSH, and GSH-Px activity. LIPUS
treatment might alleviate aluminium exposure-induced cognitive decline by
acetylation regulation of BDNF expression and reducing oxidative stress in the
hippocampus.

Introduction: F-box proteins are the substrate-recognizing subunits of SKP1
(S-phase kinase-associated protein 1)-cullin1-F-box protein (SCF) E3 ligase
complexes that play pivotal roles in multiple cellular processes, including cell 
proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, invasion, and metastasis. Dysregulation
of F-box proteins may lead to an unbalanced proteolysis of numerous protein
substrates, contributing to progression of human malignancies. However, the
prognostic values of F-box members, especially at mRNA levels, in breast cancer
(BC) are elusive. Methods: An online database, which is constructed based on the 
gene expression data and survival information downloaded from GEO
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), was used to investigate the prognostic values
of 15 members of F-box mRNA expression in BC. Results: We found that higher mRNA 
expression levels of FBXO1, FBXO31, SKP2, and FBXO5 were significantly associated
with worse prognosis for BC patients. While FBXO4 and β-TrCP1 were found to be
correlated to better overall survival (OS). Conclusion: The associated results
provide new insights into F-box members in the development and progression of BC.
Further researches to explore the F-box protein-targetting reagents for treating 
BC are needed.

Hypertension is a major risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis.
Increased carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) is generally considered as an
early marker of atherosclerosis. Recently, circulating miRNAs have been
implicated both as sensitive biomarkers and key regulators in the development of 
atherosclerosis. However, the biological functions and molecular regulatory
mechanisms for miR-575 on angiogenesis remain unknown. In our study, we first
identified up-regulation of circulating miR-575 in plasma of essential
hypertensive patients with increased CIMT (iCIMT) compared with those patients
with normal CIMT (nCIMT). Furthermore, the overexpression of miR-575 in human
umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) by its mimics significantly inhibited
migration and proliferation as well as induction of apoptosis of HUVECs.
Inhibition of miR-575 performed the reverse effects of HUVECs. We further
suggested Rab5B was the downstream target of miR-575 and knockdown of Rab5B
significantly inhibited migration and proliferation of HUVECs. Overexpression of 
Rab5B largely rescued the miR-575-mediated impairment of angiogenesis processes
including: cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis as well as activation of 
mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MEK-ERK) 
signaling. Therefore, our results uncover a novel role of miR-575 in endothelial 
cells, implying a potential biomarker and clinical target for atherosclerosis in 
hypertensive patients.

Resveratrol: Twenty Years of Growth, Development and Controversy.

Pezzuto JM(1).

Author information: 
(1)Arnold & Marie Schwartz College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences, Long Island
University, Brooklyn, NY 11201, USA.

Resveratrol was first isolated in 1939 by Takaoka from Veratrum grandiflorum O.
Loes. Following this discovery, sporadic descriptive reports appeared in the
literature. However, spurred by our seminal paper published nearly 60 years
later, resveratrol became a household word and the subject of extensive
investigation. Now, in addition to appearing in over 20,000 research papers,
resveratrol has inspired monographs, conferences, symposia, patents, chemical
derivatives, etc. In addition, dietary supplements are marketed under various
tradenames. Once resveratrol was brought to the limelight, early research tended 
to focus on pharmacological activities related to the cardiovascular system,
inflammation, and cancer but, over the years, the horizon greatly expanded.
Around 130 human clinical trials have been (or are being) conducted with varying 
results. This may be due to factors such as disparate doses (ca. 5 to 5,000
mg/day) and variable experimental settings. Further, molecular targets are
numerous and a dominant mechanism is elusive or nonexistent. In this context, the
compound is overtly promiscuous. Nonetheless, since the safety profile is
pristine, and use as a dietary supplement is prevalent, these features are not
viewed as detrimental. Given the ongoing history of resveratrol, it is reasonable
to advocate for additional development and further clinical investigation.
Topical preparations seem especially promising, as do conditions that can respond
to anti-inflammatory action and/or direct exposure, such as colon cancer
prevention. Although the ultimate fate of resveratrol remains an open question,
thus far, the compound has inspired innovative scientific concepts and enhanced
public awareness of preventative health care.

Cis-3-O-p-hydroxycinnamoyl ursolic acid (HCUA), a triterpenoid compound, was
purified from Elaeagnus oldhamii Maxim. This traditional medicinal plant has been
used for treating rheumatoid arthritis and lung disorders as well as for its
anti-inflammation and anticancer activities. This study aimed to investigate the 
anti-proliferative and apoptotic-inducing activities of HCUA in oral cancer
cells. HCUA exhibited anti-proliferative activity in oral cancer cell lines
(Ca9-22 and SAS cells), but not in normal oral fibroblasts. The inhibitory
concentration of HCUA that resulted in 50% viability was 24.0 µM and 17.8 µM for 
Ca9-22 and SAS cells, respectively. Moreover, HCUA increased the number of cells 
in the sub-G1 arrest phase and apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner in
both oral cancer cell lines, but not in normal oral fibroblasts. Importantly,
HCUA induced p53-mediated transcriptional regulation of pro-apoptotic proteins
(Bax, Bak, Bim, Noxa, and PUMA), which are associated with mitochondrial
apoptosis in oral cancer cells via the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. 
HCUA triggered the production of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) that
was ascertained to be involved in HCUA-induced apoptosis by the ROS inhibitors
YCG063 and N-acetyl-L-cysteine. As a result, HCUA had potential antitumor
activity to oral cancer cells through eliciting ROS-dependent and p53-mediated
mitochondrial apoptosis. Overall, HCUA could be applicable for the development of
anticancer agents against human oral cancer.

Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) SNHG14 is previously found to be overexpressed in
several types of cancers. However, the clinical significance and biological
function of SNHG14 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are still elusive. In
the present study, we found that SNHG14 was aberrantly up-regulated in NSCLC
tissues from patients and cell lines compared with their normal counterparts.
Increased SNHG14 expression was closely associated with aggressive tumor
progression and poor clinical outcome of NSCLC patients. Knockdown of SNHG14
inhibited NSCLC cell proliferation through inducing cell cycle arrest and
apoptosis, whereas SNHG14 overexpression exerted the opposite effects. Animal
experiment further revealed that down-regulated SNHG14 greatly inhibited NSCLC
tumor growth in vivo Further studies demonstrated that SNHG14 might serve as a
competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) by sponging miR-340 in NSCLC cells. Taken
together, our study demonstrated that SNHG14/miR-340 axis might play a novel role
in regulating the malignant behaviors of NSCLC, which provided a new potential
diagnostic and therapeutic strategy for this malignant disease.

To evaluate the role of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) in the apoptosis of 
cardiomyocytes in diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). Diabetes mellitus (DM) in rats
was induced by intraperitoneal injection of 1% streptozotocin (STZ), and lithium 
chloride (LiCl) was used to decrease the expression of GSK-3β. Hematoxylin/eosin 
(HE) staining and the terminal deoxyribonucleotide transferase-mediated
dUTP-digoxigenin nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay was conducted to evaluate the
pathological injury and apoptosis of cardiomyocytes respectively. Western blot
was applied to detect the protein expressions of Cleaved-caspase 3, caspase 3,
Bax and Bcl-2 in rat cardiomyocytes. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
was applied to detect the gene expressions of phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K), 
Akt, and GSK-3β in rat cardiomyocytes. DM-induced cardiomyocyte injuries, which
were presented as capillary basement membrane thickening, interstitial fibrosis, 
cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and necrosis in HE staining and increased apoptosis
detected by TUNEL assay. When comparing with the control group, the mRNA
expression of PI3K and Akt in DM group obviously decreased but the mRNA
expression of GSK-3β obviously elevated (P < 0.05). In addition, the ratio of
Cleaved-caspase 3/caspase 3 and Bax/Bcl-2 were notably increased in DM group
compared with control group (P < 0.05). LiCl, as an inhibitor of GSK-3 apparently
reduced the expression of GSK-3β mRNA (P < 0.05) but not the PI3K and Akt
comparing with the DM group. LiCl also attenuated the myocardial injury and
apoptosis induced by DM. The myocardial injury induced by DM is associated with
the up-regulation of GSK-3β. LiCl inhibited the expression of GSK-3β and
myocardial apoptosis in diabetic myocardium.

Transglutaminase 2 (TGase 2) plays a key role in p53 regulation, depleting p53
tumor suppressor through autophagy in renal cell carcinoma. We found that
microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3), a hallmark of
autophagy, were tightly associated with the level of TGase 2 in cancer cells.
TGase 2 overexpression increased LC3 levels, and TGase 2 knockdown decreased LC3 
levels in cancer cells. Transcript abundance of LC3 was inversely correlated with
level of wild type p53. TGase 2 knockdown using siRNA, or TGase 2 inhibition
using GK921 significantly reduced autophagy through reduction of LC3
transcription, which was followed by restoration of p53 levels in cancer cells.
TGase 2 overexpression promoted the autophagy process by LC3 induction, which was
correlated with p53 depletion in cancer cells. Rapamycin-resistant cancer cells
also showed higher expression of LC3 compared to the rapamycin-sensitive cancer
cells, which was tightly correlated with TGase 2 levels. TGase 2 knockdown or
TGase 2 inhibition sensitized rapamycin-resistant cancer cells to drug treatment.
In summary, TGase 2 induces drug resistance by potentiating autophagy through LC3
induction via p53 regulation in cancer.

We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the effect of probiotic combined with
aminosalicylic on induction remission maintenance treatment of ulcerative colitis
(UC). We conducted systematic searches in several Chinese and English databases
from inception to June 2018, screening randomized controlled trials about effect 
of probiotics combined with aminosalicylic acid on UC. The evaluation indicator
was the rate of remission. The relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence interval
(CI) were calculated. A total of 27 studies with 1942 patients were included. The
results indicated that the remission rate was significantly higher in the group
using probiotics combined with aminosalicylic acid than that in the group using
aminosalicylic acid alone (RR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.27-1.53, P=0.000). The subgroup
analysis indicated that probiotics combined with aminosalicylic acid can
significantly elevate the remission rate in both mild to moderate (RR = 1.33, 95%
CI: 1.16-1.54, P=0.000) and active stage (RR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.27-1.64, P=0.000) 
UC. In different number of bacterium, drug types and treatment periods, the
combination with probiotics can significantly increase the remission rate UC. The
funnel plot shows slight publication bias. Probiotics in conjunction with
aminosalicylic can obviously increase the clinical remission rate of activity UC 
than drug alone. There was no significant difference between combined with
mesalazine group and salicylazosulfapyridine group.

The global obesity epidemic and associated metabolic diseases require alternative
biological targets for new therapeutic strategies. In this study, we show that a 
phytochemical sulfuretin suppressed adipocyte differentiation of preadipocytes
and administration of sulfuretin to high fat diet-fed obese mice prevented
obesity and increased insulin sensitivity. These effects were associated with a
suppressed expression of inflammatory markers, induced expression of adiponectin,
and increased levels of phosphorylated ERK and AKT. To elucidate the molecular
mechanism of sulfuretin in adipocytes, we performed microarray analysis and
identified activating transcription factor 3 (Atf3) as a sulfuretin-responsive
gene. Sulfuretin elevated Atf3 mRNA and protein levels in white adipose tissue
and adipocytes. Consistently, deficiency of Atf3 promoted lipid accumulation and 
the expression of adipocyte markers. Sulfuretin's but not resveratrol's
anti-adipogenic effects were diminished in Atf3 deficient cells, indicating that 
Atf3 is an essential factor in the effects of sulfuretin. These results highlight
the usefulness of sulfuretin as a new anti-obesity intervention for the
prevention of obesity and its associated metabolic diseases.

Previous studies have shown that spinosin was implicated in the modulation of
sedation and hypnosis, while its effects on learning and memory deficits were
rarely reported. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of spinosin 
on the improvement of cognitive impairment in model mice with Alzheimer's disease
(AD) induced by Aβ₁₋₄₂ and determine the underlying mechanism. Spontaneous
locomotion assessment and Morris water maze test were performed to investigate
the impact of spinosin on behavioral activities, and the pathological changes
were assayed by biochemical analyses and histological assay. After 7 days of
intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of spinosin (100 µg/kg/day), the
cognitive impairment of mice induced by Aβ₁₋₄₂ was significantly attenuated.
Moreover, spinosin treatment effectively decreased the level of malondialdehyde
(MDA) and Aβ₁₋₄₂ accumulation in hippocampus. Aβ₁₋₄₂ induced alterations in the
expression of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and B-cell lymphoma-2
(Bcl-2), as well as inflammatory response in brain were also reversed by spinosin
treatment. These results indicated that the ameliorating effect of spinosin on
cognitive impairment might be mediated through the regulation of oxidative
stress, inflammatory process, apoptotic program and neurotrophic factor
expression, suggesting that spinosin might be beneficial to treat learning and
memory deficits in patients with AD via multi-targets.

The apoptotic effects of shikonin
(5,8-dihydroxy-2-[(1R)-1-hydroxy-4-methylpent-3-enyl]naphthalene-1,4-dione) on
the human colon cancer cell line SNU-407 were investigated in this study.
Shikonin showed dose-dependent cytotoxic activity against SNU-407 cells, with an 
estimated IC₅₀ value of 3 µM after 48 h of treatment. Shikonin induced apoptosis,
as evidenced by apoptotic body formation, sub-G₁ phase cells, and DNA
fragmentation. Shikonin induced apoptotic cell death by activating
mitogen-activated protein kinase family members, and the apoptotic process was
mediated by the activation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, leading to
activation of the PERK/elF2α/CHOP apoptotic pathway, and mitochondrial Ca²⁺
accumulation. Shikonin increased mitochondrial membrane depolarization and
altered the levels of apoptosis-related proteins, with a decrease in B cell
lymphoma (Bcl)-2 and an increase in Bcl-2-associated X protein, and subsequently,
increased expression of cleaved forms of caspase-9 and -3. Taken together, we
suggest that these mechanisms, including MAPK signaling and the ER-and
mitochondria-mediated pathways, may underlie shikonin-induced apoptosis related
to its anticancer effect.

Mesenchymal stem cells are classified as multipotent stem cells, due to their
capability to transdifferentiate into various lineages that develop from
mesoderm. Their popular appeal as cell-based therapy was initially based on the
idea of their ability to restore tissue because of their differentiation
potential in vitro; however, the lack of evidence of their differentiation to
target cells in vivo led researchers to focus on their secreted trophic factors
and their role as potential powerhouses on regulation of factors under different 
immunological environments and recover homeostasis. To date there are more than
800 clinical trials on humans related to MSCs as therapy, not to mention that in 
animals is actively being applied as therapeutic resource, though it has not been
officially approved as one. But just as how results from clinical trials are
important, so is to reveal the biological mechanisms involved on how these cells 
exert their healing properties to further enhance the application of MSCs on
potential patients. In this review, we describe characteristics of MSCs, evaluate
their benefits as tissue regenerative therapy and combination therapy, as well as
their immunological properties, activation of MSCs that dictate their secreted
factors, interactions with other immune cells, such as T cells and possible
mechanisms and pathways involved in these interactions.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are widely generated in biological processes such
as normal metabolism and response to xenobiotic exposure. While ROS can be
beneficial or harmful to cells and tissues, generation of ROS by diverse
anti-cancer drugs or phytochemicals plays an important role in the induction of
apoptosis. We recently identified a derivative of naphthalene, MS-5, that induces
apoptosis of an ovarian cell, CAOV-3. Interestingly, MS-5 induced apoptosis by
down-regulating the ROS. Cell viability was evaluated by water-soluble
tetrazolium salt (WST-1) assay. Apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometry
analysis. Intracellular ROS (H₂O₂), mitochondrial superoxide, mitochondrial
membrane potential (MMP) and effect on cycle were determined by flow cytometry.
Protein expression was assessed by western blotting. The level of ATP was
measured using ATP Colorimetric/Fluorometric Assay kit. MS-5 inhibited growth of 
ovarian cancer cell lines, CAOV-3, in a concentration- and time-dependent manner.
MS-5 also induced G1 cell cycle arrest in CAOV-3 cells, while MS-5 decreased
intracellular ROS generation. In addition, cells treated with MS-5 showed the
decrease in MMP and ATP production. In this study, we found that treatment with
MS-5 in CAOV-3 cells induced apoptosis but decreased ROS level. We suspect that
MS-5 might interfere with the minimum requirements of ROS for survival. These
perturbations appear to be concentration-dependent, suggesting that MS-5 may
induce apoptosis by interfering with ROS generation. We propose that MS-5 may be 
a potent therapeutic agent for inducing apoptosis in ovarian cancer cell through 
regulation of ROS.

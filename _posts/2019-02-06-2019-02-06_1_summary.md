## 41. Exploration of Machine Learning for Hyperuricemia Prediction Models Based on Basic Health Checkup Tests.
**Authors:** *Lee Sangwoo, Choe Eun Kyung, Park Boram*

**Journal:** *Journal of clinical medicine*

*abstract:* Machine learning (ML) is a promising methodology for classification and prediction applications in healthcare. However, this method has not been practically established for clinical data. Hyperuricemia is a biomarker of various chronic diseases. We aimed to predict uric acid status from basic healthcare checkup test results using several ML algorithms and to evaluate the performance.

## 42. An Intelligent Driver Training System Based on Real Cars.
**Authors:** *Duan Gui-Jiang, Yan Xin, Ma Hong*

**Journal:** *Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)*

*abstract:* In driver training, the correct observation of the trainees' operation is the key to ensure the training quality. The operation of the vehicle can be expressed by the vehicle state changes. This paper proposes a driver training model based on a multiple-embedded-sensor net. Six vehicle state parameters are identified as the critical features of the reverse parking machine learning model and represented quantitatively. A multiple-embedded-sensor net-based system mounted on a real vehicle is developed to collect the actual data of the six critical features. The data collected at the same time are bound together and encapsulated into a vector and sequenced by time with a label given by the multiple-embedded-sensor net. All vectors are evaluated by subjective assessment conclusions from experienced driving instructors and the positive ones are used as the training data of the model. The trained model can remind the driver of the next correct operation during training, and can also analyze the improvements after the training. The model has achieved good results in practical application. The experiments prove the validity and reliability of the proposed driver training model.

## 43. Artificial Intelligence vs. Natural Stupidity: Evaluating AI readiness for the Vietnamese Medical Information System.
**Authors:** *Vuong Quan-Hoang, Ho Manh-Tung, Vuong Thu-Trang, La Viet-Phuong, Ho Manh-Toan, Nghiem Kien-Cuong P, Tran Bach Xuan, Giang Hai-Ha, Giang Thu-Vu, Latkin Carl, Nguyen Hong-Kong T, Ho Cyrus S H, Ho Roger C M*

**Journal:** *Journal of clinical medicine*

*abstract:* This review paper presents a framework to evaluate the artificial intelligence (AI) readiness for the healthcare sector in developing countries: a combination of adequate technical or technological expertise, financial sustainability, and socio-political commitment embedded in a healthy psycho-cultural context could bring about the smooth transitioning toward an AI-powered healthcare sector. Taking the Vietnamese healthcare sector as a case study, this paper attempts to clarify the negative and positive influencers. With only about 1500 publications about AI from 1998 to 2017 according to the latest Elsevier AI report, Vietnamese physicians are still capable of applying the state-of-the-art AI techniques in their research. However, a deeper look at the funding sources suggests a lack of socio-political commitment, hence the financial sustainability, to advance the field. The AI readiness in Vietnam's healthcare also suffers from the unprepared information infrastructure-using text mining for the official annual reports from 2012 to 2016 of the Ministry of Health

## 44. Smartphone-Based Activity Recognition for Indoor Localization Using a Convolutional Neural Network.
**Authors:** *Zhou Baoding, Yang Jun, Li Qingquan*

**Journal:** *Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)*

*abstract:* In the indoor environment, the activity of the pedestrian can reflect some semantic information. These activities can be used as the landmarks for indoor localization. In this paper, we propose a pedestrian activities recognition method based on a convolutional neural network. A new convolutional neural network has been designed to learn the proper features automatically. Experiments show that the proposed method achieves approximately 98% accuracy in about 2 s in identifying nine types of activities, including still, walk, upstairs, up elevator, up escalator, down elevator, down escalator, downstairs and turning. Moreover, we have built a pedestrian activity database, which contains more than 6 GB of data of accelerometers, magnetometers, gyroscopes and barometers collected with various types of smartphones. We will make it public to contribute to academic research.

## 45. Outage Performance Analysis and SWIPT Optimization in Energy-Harvesting Wireless Sensor Network Deploying NOMA.
**Authors:** *Nguyen Hoang-Sy, Ly Tran Thai Hoc, Nguyen Thanh-Sang, Huynh Van Van, Nguyen Thanh-Long, Voznak Miroslav*

**Journal:** *Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)*

*abstract:* Thanks to the benefits of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) in wireless communications, we evaluate a wireless sensor network deploying NOMA (WSN-NOMA), where the destination can receive two data symbols in a whole transmission process with two time slots. In this work, two relaying protocols, so-called time-switching-based relaying WSN-NOMA (TSR WSN-NOMA) and power-splitting-based relaying WSN-NOMA (PSR WSN-NOMA) are deployed to study energy-harvesting (EH). Regarding the system performance analysis, we obtain the closed-form expressions for the exact and approximate outage probability (OP) in both protocols, and the delay-limited throughput is also evaluated. We then compare the two protocols theoretically, and two optimization problems are formulated to reduce the impact of OP and optimize the data rate. Our numerical and simulation results are provided to prove the theoretical and analytical analysis. Thanks to these results, a great performance gain can be achieved for both TSR WSN-NOMA and PSR WSN-NOMA if optimal values of TS and PS ratios are found. In addition, the optimized TSR WSN-NOMA outperforms that of PSR WSN-NOMA in terms of OP.

## 46. Synergistic Myoelectrical Activities of Forearm Muscles Improving Robust Recognition of Multi-Fingered Gestures.
**Authors:** *Luo Xiuying, Wu Xiaoying, Chen Lin, Zhao Yun, Zhang Li, Li Guanglin, Hou Wensheng*

**Journal:** *Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)*

*abstract:* Currently, surface electromyography (sEMG) features of the forearm multi-tendon muscles are widely used in gesture recognition, however, there are few investigations on the inherent physiological mechanism of muscle synergies. We aimed to study whether the muscle synergies could be used for gesture recognition. Five healthy participants executed five gestures of daily life (pinch, fist, open hand, grip, and extension) and the sEMG activity was acquired from six forearm muscles. A non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) algorithm was employed to decompose the pre-treated six-channel sEMG data to obtain the muscle synergy matrixes, in which the weights of each muscle channel determined the feature set for hand gesture classification. The results showed that the synergistic features of forearm muscles could be successfully clustered in the feature space, which enabled hand gestures to be recognized with high efficiency. By augmenting the number of participants, the mean recognition rate remained at more than 96% and reflected high robustness. We showed that muscle synergies can be well applied to gesture recognition.

#### [21. A large scale screening study with a SMR-based BCI: Categorization of BCI users and differences in their SMR activity.](http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0207351){: .btn}

**Journal:** *PloS one*

*abstract:* Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are inefficient for a non-negligible part of the population, estimated around 25%. To understand this phenomenon in Sensorimotor Rhythm (SMR) based BCIs, data from a large-scale screening study conducted on 80 novice participants with the Berlin BCI system and its standard machine-learning approach were investigated. Each participant performed one BCI session with resting state Encephalography, Motor Observation, Motor Execution and Motor Imagery recordings and 128 electrodes. A significant portion of the participants (40%) could not achieve BCI control (feedback performance > 70%). Based on the performance of the calibration and feedback runs, BCI users were stratified in three groups. Analyses directed to detect and elucidate the differences in the SMR activity of these groups were performed. Statistics on reactive frequencies, task prevalence and classification results are reported. Based on their SMR activity, also a systematic list of potential reasons leading to performance drops and thus hints for possible improvements of BCI experimental design are given. The categorization of BCI users has several advantages, allowing researchers 1) to select subjects for further analyses as well as for testing new BCI paradigms or algorithms, 2) to adopt a better subject-dependent training strategy and 3) easier comparisons between different studies.

#### [22. Using an optimal set of features with a machine learning-based approach to predict effector proteins for Legionella pneumophila.](http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0202312){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Esna Ashari Zhila, Brayton Kelly A, Broschat Shira L*

**Journal:** *PloS one*

*abstract:* Type IV secretion systems exist in a number of bacterial pathogens and are used to secrete effector proteins directly into host cells in order to change their environment making the environment hospitable for the bacteria. In recent years, several machine learning algorithms have been developed to predict effector proteins, potentially facilitating experimental verification. However, inconsistencies exist between their results. Previously we analysed the disparate sets of predictive features used in these algorithms to determine an optimal set of 370 features for effector prediction. This study focuses on the best way to use these optimal features by designing three machine learning classifiers, comparing our results with those of others, and obtaining de novo results. We chose the pathogen Legionella pneumophila strain Philadelphia-1, a cause of Legionnaires' disease, because it has many validated effector proteins and others have developed machine learning prediction tools for it. While all of our models give good results indicating that our optimal features are quite robust, Model 1, which uses all 370 features with a support vector machine, has slightly better accuracy. Moreover, Model 1 predicted 472 effector proteins that are deemed highly probable to be effectors and include 94% of known effectors. Although the results of our three models agree well with those of other researchers, their models only predicted 126 and 311 candidate effectors.

#### [23. (Meta-)stability and Core-Shell Dynamics of Gold Nanoclusters at Finite Temperature.](https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.8b03397){: .btn}

*abstract:* Gold nanoclusters have been the focus of numerous computational studies, but an atomistic understanding of their structural and dynamical properties at finite temperature is far from satisfactory. To address this deficiency, we investigate gold nanoclusters via ab initio molecular dynamics, in a range of sizes where a core-shell morphology is observed. We analyze their structure and dynamics using state-of-the-art techniques, including unsupervised machine-learning nonlinear dimensionality reduction (sketch-map) for describing the similarities and differences among the range of sampled configurations. In the examined temperature range between 300 and 600 K, we find that whereas the gold nanoclusters exhibit continuous structural rearrangement, they are not amorphous. Instead, they clearly show persistent motifs: a cationic core of 1-5 atoms is loosely bound to a shell which typically displays a substructure resulting from the competition between locally spherical versus planar fragments. Besides illuminating the properties of core-shell gold nanoclusters, the present study proposes a set of useful tools for understanding their nature in operando.

**Journal:** *Brain imaging and behavior*

*abstract:* The carotenoids lutein (L) and zeaxanthin (Z) accumulate in retinal regions of the eye and have long been shown to benefit visual health. A growing literature suggests cognitive benefits as well, particularly in older adults. The present randomized controlled trial sought to investigate the effects of L and Z on brain function using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). It was hypothesized that L and Z supplementation would (1) improve intra-network integrity of default mode network (DMN) and (2) reduce inter-network connectivity between DMN and other resting state networks. 48 community-dwelling older adults (mean age = 72 years) were randomly assigned to receive a daily L (10 mg) and Z (2 mg) supplement or a placebo for 1 year. Resting state fMRI data were acquired at baseline and post-intervention. A dictionary learning and sparse coding computational framework, based on machine learning principles, was used to investigate intervention-related changes in functional connectivity. DMN integrity was evaluated by calculating spatial overlap rate with a well-established DMN template provided in the neuroscience literature. Inter-network connectivity was evaluated via time series correlations between DMN and nine other resting state networks. Contrary to expectation, results indicated that L and Z significantly increased rather than decreased inter-network connectivity (Cohen's d = 0.89). A significant intra-network effect on DMN integrity was not observed. Rather than restoring what has been described in the available literature as a "youth-like" pattern of intrinsic brain activity, L and Z may facilitate the aging brain's capacity for compensation by enhancing integration between networks that tend to be functionally segregated earlier in the lifespan.

**Journal:** *Journal of digital imaging*

*abstract:* Highly accurate detection of the intracranial hemorrhage without delay is a critical clinical issue for the diagnostic decision and treatment in an emergency room. In the context of a study on diagnostic accuracy, there is a tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity. In order to improve sensitivity while preserving specificity, we propose a cascade deep learning model constructed using two convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and dual fully convolutional networks (FCNs). The cascade CNN model is built for identifying bleeding; hereafter the dual FCN is to detect five different subtypes of intracranial hemorrhage and to delineate their lesions. Using a total of 135,974 CT images including 33,391 images labeled as bleeding, each of CNN/FCN models was trained separately on image data preprocessed by two different settings of window level/width. One is a default window (50/100[level/width]) and the other is a stroke window setting (40/40). By combining them, we obtained a better outcome on both binary classification and segmentation of hemorrhagic lesions compared to a single CNN and FCN model. In determining whether it is bleeding or not, there was around 1% improvement in sensitivity (97.91% [± 0.47]) while retaining specificity (98.76% [± 0.10]). For delineation of bleeding lesions, we obtained overall segmentation performance at 80.19% in precision and 82.15% in recall which is 3.44% improvement compared to using a single FCN model.

#### [29. Nucleotide-level Convolutional Neural Networks for Pre-miRNA Classification.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-36946-4){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Zheng Xueming, Xu Shungao, Zhang Ying, Huang Xinxiang*

**Journal:** *Scientific reports*

*abstract:* Due to the biogenesis difference, miRNAs can be divided into canonical microRNAs and mirtrons. Compared to canonical microRNAs, mirtrons are less conserved and hard to be identified. Except stringent annotations based on experiments, many in silico computational methods have be developed to classify miRNAs. Although several machine learning classifiers delivered high classification performance, all the predictors depended heavily on the selection of calculated features. Here, we introduced nucleotide-level convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for pre-miRNAs classification. By using "one-hot" encoding and padding, pre-miRNAs were converted into matrixes with the same shape. The convolution and max-pooling operations can automatically extract features from pre-miRNAs sequences. Evaluation on test dataset showed that our models had a satisfactory performance. Our investigation showed that it was feasible to apply CNNs to extract features from biological sequences. Since there are many hyperparameters can be tuned in CNNs, we believe that the performance of nucleotide-level convolutional neural networks can be greatly improved in the future.

**Journal:** *Scientific reports*

*abstract:* Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease where substantial heterogeneity in clinical presentation urgently requires a better stratification of patients for the development of drug trials and clinical care. In this study we explored stratification through a crowdsourcing approach, the DREAM Prize4Life ALS Stratification Challenge. Using data from >10,000 patients from ALS clinical trials and 1479 patients from community-based patient registers, more than 30 teams developed new approaches for machine learning and clustering, outperforming the best current predictions of disease outcome. We propose a new method to integrate and analyze patient clusters across methods, showing a clear pattern of consistent and clinically relevant sub-groups of patients that also enabled the reliable classification of new patients. Our analyses reveal novel insights in ALS and describe for the first time the potential of a crowdsourcing to uncover hidden patient sub-populations, and to accelerate disease understanding and therapeutic development.

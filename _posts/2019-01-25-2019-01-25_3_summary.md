#### [2. Bridging large-scale neuronal recordings and large-scale network models using dimensionality reduction.](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0959-4388(18)30134-X){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Williamson Ryan C, Doiron Brent, Smith Matthew A, Yu Byron M*

**Journal:** *Current opinion in neurobiology*

*abstract:* A long-standing goal in neuroscience has been to bring together neuronal recordings and neural network modeling to understand brain function. Neuronal recordings can inform the development of network models, and network models can in turn provide predictions for subsequent experiments. Traditionally, neuronal recordings and network models have been related using single-neuron and pairwise spike train statistics. We review here recent studies that have begun to relate neuronal recordings and network models based on the multi-dimensional structure of neuronal population activity, as identified using dimensionality reduction. This approach has been used to study working memory, decision making, motor control, and more. Dimensionality reduction has provided common ground for incisive comparisons and tight interplay between neuronal recordings and network models.

**Journal:** *NeuroImage*

*abstract:* Connectomics has proved promising in quantifying and understanding the effects of development, aging and an array of diseases on the brain. In this work, we propose a new structural connectivity measure from diffusion MRI that allows us to incorporate direct brain connections, as well as indirect ones that would not be otherwise accounted for by standard techniques and that may be key for the better understanding of function from structure. From our experiments on the Human Connectome Project dataset, we find that our measure of structural connectivity better correlates with functional connectivity than streamline tractography does, meaning that it provides new structural information related to function. Through additional experiments on the ADNI-2 dataset, we demonstrate the ability of this new measure to better discriminate different stages of Alzheimer's disease. Our findings suggest that this measure is useful in the study of the normal brain structure, and for quantifying the effects of disease on the brain structure.

**Authors:** *Lauschke Volker M, Zhou Yitian, Ingelman-Sundberg Magnus*

**Journal:** *Pharmacology & therapeutics*

*abstract:* Individuals differ substantially in their response to pharmacological treatment. Personalized medicine aspires to embrace these inter-individual differences and customize therapy by taking a wealth of patient-specific data into account. Pharmacogenomic constitutes a cornerstone of personalized medicine that provides therapeutic guidance based on the genomic profile of a given patient. Pharmacogenomics already has applications in the clinics, particularly in oncology, whereas future development in this area is needed in order to establish pharmacogenomic biomarkers as useful clinical tools. In this review we present an updated overview of current and emerging pharmacogenomic biomarkers in different therapeutic areas and critically discuss their potential to transform clinical care. Furthermore, we discuss opportunities of technological, methodological and institutional advances to improve biomarker discovery. We also summarize recent progress in our understanding of epigenetic effects on drug disposition and response, including a discussion of the only few pharmacogenomic biomarkers implemented into routine care. We anticipate, in part due to exciting rapid developments in Next Generation Sequencing technologies, machine learning methods and national biobanks, that the field will make great advances in the upcoming years towards unlocking the full potential of genomic data.

#### [6. Low-Temperature Side Contact to Carbon Nanotube Transistors: Resistance Distributions Down to 10 nm Contact Length.](https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.nanolett.8b04370){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Pitner Gregory, Hills Gage, Llinas Juan Pablo, Persson Karl-Magnus, Park Rebecca, Bokor Jeffrey, Mitra Subhasish, Wong H-S Philip*

**Journal:** *Nano letters*

*abstract:* Carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNFETs) promise to improve the energy efficiency, speed, and transistor density of very large scale integration circuits owing to the intrinsic thin channel body and excellent charge transport properties of carbon nanotubes. Low-temperature fabrication (e.g., <400 °C) is a key enabler for the monolithic three-dimensional (3D) integration of CNFET digital logic into a device technology platform that overcomes memory bandwidth bottlenecks for data-abundant applications such as big-data analytics and machine learning. However, high contact resistance for short CNFET contacts has been a major roadblock to establishing CNFETs as a viable technology because the contact resistance, in series with the channel resistance, reduces the on-state current of CNFETs. Additionally, the variation in contact resistance remains unstudied for short contacts and will further degrade the energy efficiency and speed of CNFET circuits. In this work, we investigate by experiments the contact resistance and statistical variation of room-temperature fabricated CNFET contacts down to 10 nm contact lengths. These CNFET contacts are ∼15 nm shorter than the state-of-the-art Si CMOS "7 nm node" contact length, allowing for multiple generations of future scaling of the transistor-contacted gate pitch. For the 10 nm contacts, we report contact resistance values down to 6.5 kΩ per source/drain contact for a single carbon nanotube (CNT) with a median contact resistance of 18.2 kΩ. The 10 nm contacts reduce the CNFET current by as little as 13% at V

#### [8. Instanton rate constant calculations using interpolated potential energy surfaces in nonredundant, rotationally and translationally invariant coordinates.](https://doi.org/10.1002/jcc.25770){: .btn}
**Authors:** *McConnell Sean R, Kästner Johannes*

**Journal:** *Journal of computational chemistry*

*abstract:* A trivial flaw in the utilization of artificial neural networks in interpolating chemical potential energy surfaces (PES) whose descriptors are Cartesian coordinates is their dependence on simple translations and rotations of the molecule under consideration. A different set of descriptors can be chosen to circumvent this problem, internuclear distances, inverse internuclear distances or z-matrix coordinates are three such descriptors. The objective is to use an interpolated PES in instanton rate constant calculations, hence information on the energy, gradient, and Hessian is required at coordinates in the vicinity of the tunneling path. Instanton theory relies on smoothly fitted Hessians, therefore we use energy, gradients, and Hessians in the training procedure. A major challenge is presented in the proper back-transformation of the output gradients and Hessians from internal coordinates to Cartesian coordinates. We perform comparisons between our method, a previous approach and on-the-fly rate constant calcuations on the hydrogen abstraction from methanol and on the hydrogen addition to isocyanic acid. © 2018Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

**Authors:** *Hoffman John, Emaminejad Nastaran, Wahi-Anwar Muhammad, Kim Grace H, Brown Matthew, Young Stefano, McNitt-Gray Michael*

**Journal:** *Medical physics*

*abstract:* With recent substantial improvements in modern computing, interest in quantitative imaging with CT has seen a dramatic increase. As a result, the need to both create and analyze large, high-quality datasets of clinical studies has increased as well. At present, no efficient, widely-available method exists to accomplish this. The purpose of this technical note is to describe an open-source high-throughput computational pipeline framework for the reconstruction and analysis of diagnostic CT imaging data to conduct large-scale quantitative imaging studies and to accelerate and improve quantitative imaging research.

#### [10. Kinetic and thermodynamic insights into sodium ion translocation through the μ-opioid receptor from molecular dynamics and machine learning analysis.](http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006689){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Hu Xiaohu, Wang Yibo, Hunkele Amanda, Provasi Davide, Pasternak Gavril W, Filizola Marta*

**Journal:** *PLoS computational biology*

*abstract:* The differential modulation of agonist and antagonist binding to opioid receptors (ORs) by sodium (Na+) has been known for decades. To shed light on the molecular determinants, thermodynamics, and kinetics of Na+ translocation through the μ-OR (MOR), we used a multi-ensemble Markov model framework combining equilibrium and non-equilibrium atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of Na+ binding to MOR active or inactive crystal structures embedded in an explicit lipid bilayer. We identify an energetically favorable, continuous ion pathway through the MOR active conformation only, and provide, for the first time: i) estimates of the energy differences and required timescales of Na+ translocation in inactive and active MORs, ii) estimates of Na+-induced changes to agonist binding validated by radioligand measurements, and iii) testable hypotheses of molecular determinants and correlated motions involved in this translocation, which are likely to play a key role in MOR signaling.

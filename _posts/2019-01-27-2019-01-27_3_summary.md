#### [21. Using deep-learning algorithms to derive basic characteristics of social media users: The Brexit campaign as a case study.](http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0211013){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Mancosu Moreno, Bobba Giuliano*

**Journal:** *PloS one*

*abstract:* A recurrent criticism concerning the use of online social media data in political science research is the lack of demographic information about social media users. By employing a face-recognition algorithm to the profile pictures of Facebook users, the paper derives two fundamental demographic characteristics (age and gender) of a sample of Facebook users who interacted with the most relevant British parties in the two weeks before the Brexit referendum of 23 June 2016. The article achieves the goals of (i) testing the precision of the algorithm, (ii) testing its validity, (iii) inferring new evidence on digital mobilisation, and (iv) tracing the path for future developments and application of the algorithm. The findings show that the algorithm is reliable and that it can be fruitfully used in political and social sciences both to confirm the validity of survey data and to obtain information from populations that are generally unavailable within traditional surveys.

#### [22. A large scale screening study with a SMR-based BCI: Categorization of BCI users and differences in their SMR activity.](http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0207351){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Sannelli Claudia, Vidaurre Carmen, Müller Klaus-Robert, Blankertz Benjamin*

**Journal:** *PloS one*

*abstract:* Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) are inefficient for a non-negligible part of the population, estimated around 25%. To understand this phenomenon in Sensorimotor Rhythm (SMR) based BCIs, data from a large-scale screening study conducted on 80 novice participants with the Berlin BCI system and its standard machine-learning approach were investigated. Each participant performed one BCI session with resting state Encephalography, Motor Observation, Motor Execution and Motor Imagery recordings and 128 electrodes. A significant portion of the participants (40%) could not achieve BCI control (feedback performance > 70%). Based on the performance of the calibration and feedback runs, BCI users were stratified in three groups. Analyses directed to detect and elucidate the differences in the SMR activity of these groups were performed. Statistics on reactive frequencies, task prevalence and classification results are reported. Based on their SMR activity, also a systematic list of potential reasons leading to performance drops and thus hints for possible improvements of BCI experimental design are given. The categorization of BCI users has several advantages, allowing researchers 1) to select subjects for further analyses as well as for testing new BCI paradigms or algorithms, 2) to adopt a better subject-dependent training strategy and 3) easier comparisons between different studies.

#### [23. Using an optimal set of features with a machine learning-based approach to predict effector proteins for Legionella pneumophila.](http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0202312){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Esna Ashari Zhila, Brayton Kelly A, Broschat Shira L*

**Journal:** *PloS one*

*abstract:* Type IV secretion systems exist in a number of bacterial pathogens and are used to secrete effector proteins directly into host cells in order to change their environment making the environment hospitable for the bacteria. In recent years, several machine learning algorithms have been developed to predict effector proteins, potentially facilitating experimental verification. However, inconsistencies exist between their results. Previously we analysed the disparate sets of predictive features used in these algorithms to determine an optimal set of 370 features for effector prediction. This study focuses on the best way to use these optimal features by designing three machine learning classifiers, comparing our results with those of others, and obtaining de novo results. We chose the pathogen Legionella pneumophila strain Philadelphia-1, a cause of Legionnaires' disease, because it has many validated effector proteins and others have developed machine learning prediction tools for it. While all of our models give good results indicating that our optimal features are quite robust, Model 1, which uses all 370 features with a support vector machine, has slightly better accuracy. Moreover, Model 1 predicted 472 effector proteins that are deemed highly probable to be effectors and include 94% of known effectors. Although the results of our three models agree well with those of other researchers, their models only predicted 126 and 311 candidate effectors.

#### [24. (Meta-)stability and Core-Shell Dynamics of Gold Nanoclusters at Finite Temperature.](https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jpclett.8b03397){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Guedes-Sobrinho Diego, Wang Weiqi, Hamilton Ian P, Da Silva Juarez L F, Ghiringhelli Luca M*

**Journal:** *The journal of physical chemistry letters*

*abstract:* Gold nanoclusters have been the focus of numerous computational studies, but an atomistic understanding of their structural and dynamical properties at finite temperature is far from satisfactory. To address this deficiency, we investigate gold nanoclusters via ab initio molecular dynamics, in a range of sizes where a core-shell morphology is observed. We analyze their structure and dynamics using state-of-the-art techniques, including unsupervised machine-learning nonlinear dimensionality reduction (sketch-map) for describing the similarities and differences among the range of sampled configurations. In the examined temperature range between 300 and 600 K, we find that whereas the gold nanoclusters exhibit continuous structural rearrangement, they are not amorphous. Instead, they clearly show persistent motifs: a cationic core of 1-5 atoms is loosely bound to a shell which typically displays a substructure resulting from the competition between locally spherical versus planar fragments. Besides illuminating the properties of core-shell gold nanoclusters, the present study proposes a set of useful tools for understanding their nature in operando.

**Authors:** *Lindbergh Cutter A, Lv Jinglei, Zhao Yu, Mewborn Catherine M, Puente Antonio N, Terry Douglas P, Renzi-Hammond Lisa M, Hammond Billy R, Liu Tianming, Miller L Stephen*

**Journal:** *Brain imaging and behavior*

*abstract:* The carotenoids lutein (L) and zeaxanthin (Z) accumulate in retinal regions of the eye and have long been shown to benefit visual health. A growing literature suggests cognitive benefits as well, particularly in older adults. The present randomized controlled trial sought to investigate the effects of L and Z on brain function using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). It was hypothesized that L and Z supplementation would (1) improve intra-network integrity of default mode network (DMN) and (2) reduce inter-network connectivity between DMN and other resting state networks. 48 community-dwelling older adults (mean age = 72 years) were randomly assigned to receive a daily L (10 mg) and Z (2 mg) supplement or a placebo for 1 year. Resting state fMRI data were acquired at baseline and post-intervention. A dictionary learning and sparse coding computational framework, based on machine learning principles, was used to investigate intervention-related changes in functional connectivity. DMN integrity was evaluated by calculating spatial overlap rate with a well-established DMN template provided in the neuroscience literature. Inter-network connectivity was evaluated via time series correlations between DMN and nine other resting state networks. Contrary to expectation, results indicated that L and Z significantly increased rather than decreased inter-network connectivity (Cohen's d = 0.89). A significant intra-network effect on DMN integrity was not observed. Rather than restoring what has been described in the available literature as a "youth-like" pattern of intrinsic brain activity, L and Z may facilitate the aging brain's capacity for compensation by enhancing integration between networks that tend to be functionally segregated earlier in the lifespan.

#### [28. Improving Sensitivity on Identification and Delineation of Intracranial Hemorrhage Lesion Using Cascaded Deep Learning Models.](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10278-018-00172-1){: .btn}

**Journal:** *Journal of digital imaging*

*abstract:* Highly accurate detection of the intracranial hemorrhage without delay is a critical clinical issue for the diagnostic decision and treatment in an emergency room. In the context of a study on diagnostic accuracy, there is a tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity. In order to improve sensitivity while preserving specificity, we propose a cascade deep learning model constructed using two convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and dual fully convolutional networks (FCNs). The cascade CNN model is built for identifying bleeding; hereafter the dual FCN is to detect five different subtypes of intracranial hemorrhage and to delineate their lesions. Using a total of 135,974 CT images including 33,391 images labeled as bleeding, each of CNN/FCN models was trained separately on image data preprocessed by two different settings of window level/width. One is a default window (50/100[level/width]) and the other is a stroke window setting (40/40). By combining them, we obtained a better outcome on both binary classification and segmentation of hemorrhagic lesions compared to a single CNN and FCN model. In determining whether it is bleeding or not, there was around 1% improvement in sensitivity (97.91% [± 0.47]) while retaining specificity (98.76% [± 0.10]). For delineation of bleeding lesions, we obtained overall segmentation performance at 80.19% in precision and 82.15% in recall which is 3.44% improvement compared to using a single FCN model.

**Journal:** *Pattern recognition*

*abstract:* Generalizability of algorithms for binary cancer vs. no cancer classification is unknown for clinically more significant multi-class scenarios where intermediate categories have different risk factors and treatment strategies. We present a system that classifies whole slide images (WSI) of breast biopsies into five diagnostic categories. First, a saliency detector that uses a pipeline of four fully convolutional networks, trained with samples from records of pathologists' screenings, performs multi-scale localization of diagnostically relevant regions of interest in WSI. Then, a convolutional network, trained from consensus-derived reference samples, classifies image patches as non-proliferative or proliferative changes, atypical ductal hyperplasia, ductal carcinoma in situ, and invasive carcinoma. Finally, the saliency and classification maps are fused for pixel-wise labeling and slide-level categorization. Experiments using 240 WSI showed that both saliency detector and classifier networks performed better than competing algorithms, and the five-class slide-level accuracy of 55% was not statistically different from the predictions of 45 pathologists. We also present example visualizations of the learned representations for breast cancer diagnosis.

**Journal:** *Scientific reports*

*abstract:* Due to a growing demand for a viable label-free observation method in the biomedical field, many techniques, such as quantitative phase imaging and Raman spectroscopy, have been studied, and a complementary approach, hyperspectral imaging, has also been introduced. We developed a high-speed hyperspectral imaging microscopy imaging method with commercially available apparatus, employing a liquid crystal tunable bandpass filter combined with a pixel-wise machine learning classification. Next, we evaluated the feasibility of the application of this method for stem cell research utilizing neural stem cells. Employing this microscopy method, with a 562 × 562 μm

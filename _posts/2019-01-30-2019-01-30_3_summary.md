*abstract:* Deep learning has rapidly advanced in various fields within the past few years and has recently gained particular attention in the radiology community. This article provides an introduction to deep learning technology and presents the stages that are entailed in the design process of deep learning radiology research. In addition, the article details the results of a survey of the application of deep learning-specifically, the application of convolutional neural networks-to radiologic imaging that was focused on the following five major system organs: chest, breast, brain, musculoskeletal system, and abdomen and pelvis. The survey of the studies is followed by a discussion about current challenges and future trends and their potential implications for radiology.

*abstract:* Autism spectrum disorder is a developmental disorder that describes certain challenges associated with communication (verbal and non-verbal), social skills, and repetitive behaviors. Typically, autism spectrum disorder is diagnosed in a clinical environment by licensed specialists using procedures which can be lengthy and cost-ineffective. Therefore, scholars in the medical, psychology, and applied behavioral science fields have in recent decades developed screening methods such as the Autism Spectrum Quotient and Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers for diagnosing autism and other pervasive developmental disorders. The accuracy and efficiency of these screening methods rely primarily on the experience and knowledge of the user, as well as the items designed in the screening method. One promising direction to improve the accuracy and efficiency of autism spectrum disorder detection is to build classification systems using intelligent technologies such as machine learning. Machine learning offers advanced techniques that construct automated classifiers that can be exploited by users and clinicians to significantly improve sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and efficiency in diagnostic discovery. This article proposes a new machine learning method called Rules-Machine Learning that not only detects autistic traits of cases and controls but also offers users knowledge bases (rules) that can be utilized by domain experts in understanding the reasons behind the classification. Empirical results on three data sets related to children, adolescents, and adults show that Rules-Machine Learning offers classifiers with higher predictive accuracy, sensitivity, harmonic mean, and specificity than those of other machine learning approaches such as Boosting, Bagging, decision trees, and rule induction.

**Journal:** *International journal for numerical methods in biomedical engineering*

*abstract:* Despite its great success in various physical modeling, differential geometry (DG) has rarely been devised as a versatile tool for analyzing large, diverse and complex molecular and biomolecular datasets due to the limited understanding of its potential power in dimensionality reduction and its ability to encode essential chemical and biological information in differentiable manifolds.

**Authors:** *Wang Tonghe, Lei Yang, Tang Haipeng, He Zhuo, Castillo Richard, Wang Cheng, Li Dianfu, Higgins Kristin, Liu Tian, Curran Walter J, Zhou Weihua, Yang Xiaofeng*

**Journal:** *Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology*

*abstract:* The performance of left ventricular (LV) functional assessment using gated myocardial perfusion SPECT (MPS) relies on the accuracy of segmentation. Current methods require manual adjustments that are tedious and subjective. We propose a novel machine-learning-based method to automatically segment LV myocardium and measure its volume in gated MPS imaging without human intervention.

**Authors:** **

**Journal:** *Insights into imaging*

*abstract:* This Strategic Research Agenda identifies current challenges and needs in healthcare, illustrates how biomedical imaging and derived data can help to address these, and aims to stimulate dedicated research funding efforts.Medicine is currently moving towards a more tailored, patient-centric approach by providing personalised solutions for the individual patient. Innovation in biomedical imaging plays a key role in this process as it addresses the current needs for individualised prevention, treatment, therapy response monitoring, and image-guided surgery.The use of non-invasive biomarkers facilitates better therapy prediction and monitoring, leading to improved patient outcomes. Innovative diagnostic imaging technologies provide information about disease characteristics which, coupled with biological, genetic and -omics data, will contribute to an individualised diagnosis and therapy approach.In the emerging field of theranostics, imaging tools together with therapeutic agents enable the selection of best treatments and allow tailored therapeutic interventions.For prenatal monitoring, the use of innovative imaging technologies can ensure an early detection of malfunctions or disease.The application of biomedical imaging for diagnosis and management of lifestyle-induced diseases will help to avoid disease development through lifestyle changes.Artificial intelligence and machine learning in imaging will facilitate the improvement of image interpretation and lead to better disease prediction and therapy planning.As biomedical imaging technologies and analysis of existing imaging data provide solutions to current challenges and needs in healthcare, appropriate funding for dedicated research is needed to implement the innovative approaches for the wellbeing of citizens and patients.

**Authors:** *Grisafi Andrea, Fabrizio Alberto, Meyer Benjamin, Wilkins David M, Corminboeuf Clemence, Ceriotti Michele*

**Journal:** *ACS central science*

*abstract:* The electronic charge density plays a central role in determining the behavior of matter at the atomic scale, but its computational evaluation requires demanding electronic-structure calculations. We introduce an atom-centered, symmetry-adapted framework to machine-learn the valence charge density based on a small number of reference calculations. The model is highly transferable, meaning it can be trained on electronic-structure data of small molecules and used to predict the charge density of larger compounds with low, linear-scaling cost. Applications are shown for various hydrocarbon molecules of increasing complexity and flexibility, and demonstrate the accuracy of the model when predicting the density on octane and octatetraene after training exclusively on butane and butadiene. This transferable, data-driven model can be used to interpret experiments, accelerate electronic structure calculations, and compute electrostatic interactions in molecules and condensed-phase systems.

**Authors:** *Upadhyay Atul Kumar, Sowdhamini Ramanathan*

**Journal:** *Bioinformatics and biology insights*

*abstract:* Computational approaches to high-throughput data are gaining importance because of explosion of sequences in the post-genomic era. This explosion of sequence data creates a huge gap among the domains of sequence structure and function, since the experimental techniques to determine the structure and function are very expensive, time taking, and laborious in nature. Therefore, there is an urgent need to emphasize on the development of computational approaches in the field of biological systems. Engagement of proteins in quaternary arrangements, such as domain swapping, might be relevant for higher compatibility of such genes at stress conditions. In this study, the capacity to engage in domain swapping was predicted from mere sequence information in the whole genome of holy Basil (

**Authors:** *Shim Hyunjin*

**Journal:** *Evolutionary bioinformatics online*

*abstract:* Recent studies reveal that even the smallest genomes such as viruses evolve through complex and stochastic processes, and the assumption of independent alleles is not valid in most applications. Advances in sequencing technologies produce multiple time-point whole-genome data, which enable potential interactions between these alleles to be investigated empirically. To investigate these interactions, we represent alleles as distributed vectors that encode for relationships with other alleles in the course of evolution and apply artificial neural networks to time-sampled whole-genome datasets for feature learning. We build this platform using methods and algorithms derived from natural language processing (NLP), and we denote it as the nucleotide skip-gram neural network. We learn distributed vectors of alleles using the changes in allele frequency of echovirus 11 in the presence or absence of the disinfectant (ClO

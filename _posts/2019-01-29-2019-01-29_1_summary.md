*abstract:* Automatic algorithms for disease diagnosis are being thoroughly researched for use in clinical settings. They usually rely on pre-identified biomarkers to highlight the existence of certain problems. However, finding such biomarkers for neurodevelopmental disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) has challenged researchers for many years. With enough data and computational power, machine learning (ML) algorithms can be used to interpret the data and extract the best biomarkers from thousands of candidates. In this study, we used the fMRI data of 816 individuals enrolled in the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) to introduce a new biomarker extraction pipeline for ASD that relies on the use of graph theoretical metrics of fMRI-based functional connectivity to inform a support vector machine (SVM). Furthermore, we split the dataset into 5 age groups to account for the effect of aging on functional connectivity. Our methodology achieved better results than most state-of-the-art investigations on this dataset with the best model for the >30 years age group achieving an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 95, 97, and 95%, respectively. Our results suggest that measures of centrality provide the highest contribution to the classification power of the models.

**Journal:** *Frontiers in neuroscience*

*abstract:* Parkinson's disease is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder in the Western world. It is estimated that the neuronal loss related to Parkinson's disease precedes the clinical diagnosis by more than 10 years (prodromal phase) which leads to a subtle decline that translates into non-specific clinical signs and symptoms. By leveraging diffusion magnetic resonance imaging brain (MRI) data evaluated longitudinally, at least at two different time points, we have the opportunity of detecting and measuring brain changes early on in the neurodegenerative process, thereby allowing early detection and monitoring that can enable development and testing of disease modifying therapies. In this study, we were able to define a longitudinal degenerative Parkinson's disease progression pattern using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging connectivity information. Such pattern was discovered using a

*abstract:* There is substantial interest in assessing how exposure to environmental mixtures, such as chemical mixtures, affect child health. Researchers are also interested in identifying critical time windows of susceptibility to these complex mixtures. A recently developed method, called lagged kernel machine regression (LKMR), simultaneously accounts for these research questions by estimating effects of time-varying mixture exposures, and identifying their critical exposure windows. However, LKMR inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods (MCMC-LKMR) is computationally burdensome and time intensive for large datasets, limiting its applicability. Therefore, we develop a mean field variational Bayesian inference procedure for lagged kernel machine regression (MFVB-LKMR). The procedure achieves computational efficiency and reasonable accuracy as compared with the corresponding MCMC estimation method. Updating parameters using MFVB may only take minutes, while the equivalent MCMC method may take many hours or several days. We apply MFVB-LKMR to PROGRESS, a prospective cohort study in Mexico. Results from a subset of PROGRESS using MFVB-LKMR provide evidence of significant positive association between second trimester cobalt levels and z-scored birthweight. This positive association is heightened by cesium exposure. MFVB-LKMR is a promising approach for computationally efficient analysis of environmental health datasets, to identify critical windows of exposure to complex mixtures.

*abstract:* Artificial intelligence (AI), beyond the concrete applications that have already become part of our daily lives, makes it possible to process numerous and heterogeneous data and knowledge, and to understand potentially complex and abstract rules in a manner human intelligence can but without human intervention. AI combines two properties, self-learning by the successive and repetitive processing of data as well as the capacity to adapt, that is to say the possibility for a scripted program to deal with multiple situations likely to vary over time. Roundtable experts confirmed the potential contribution and theoretical benefit of AI in clinical research and in improving the efficiency of patient care. Experts also measured, as is the case for any new process that people need to get accustomed to, its impact on practices and mindset. To maximize the benefits of AI, four critical points have been identified. The careful consideration of these four points conditions the technical integration and the appropriation by all actors of the life science spectrum: researchers, regulators, drug developers, care establishments, medical practitioners and, above all, patients and the civil society. 1st critical point: produce tangible demonstrations of the contributions of AI in clinical research by quantifying its benefits. 2nd critical point: build trust to foster dissemination and acceptability of AI in healthcare thanks to an adapted regulatory framework. 3rd critical point: ensure the availability of technical skills, which implies an investment in training, the attractiveness of the health sector relative to tech-heavy sectors and the development of ergonomic data collection tools for all health operators. 4th critical point: organize a system of governance for a distributed and secure model at the national level to aggregate the information and services existing at the local level. Thirty-seven concrete recommendations have been formulated which should pave the way for a widespread adoption of AI in clinical research. In this context, the French "Health data hub" initiative constitutes an ideal opportunity.

**Journal:** *NeuroImage*

*abstract:* Neuroscience has a long history of inferring brain function by examining the relationship between brain injury and subsequent behavioral impairments. The primary advantage of this method over correlative methods is that it can tell us if a certain brain region is necessary for a given cognitive function. In addition, lesion-based analyses provide unique insights into clinical deficits. In the last decade, statistical voxel-based lesion behavior mapping (VLBM) emerged as a powerful method for understanding the architecture of the human brain. This review illustrates how VLBM improves our knowledge of functional brain architecture, as well as how it is inherently limited by its mass-univariate approach. A wide array of recently developed methods appear to supplement traditional VLBM. This paper provides an overview of these new methods, including the use of specialized imaging modalities, the combination of structural imaging with normative connectome data, as well as multivariate analyses of structural imaging data. We see these new methods as complementing rather than replacing traditional VLBM, providing synergistic tools to answer related questions. Finally, we discuss the potential for these methods to become established in cognitive neuroscience and in clinical applications.

**Journal:** *Zeitschrift fur medizinische Physik*

*abstract:* This paper tries to give a gentle introduction to deep learning in medical image processing, proceeding from theoretical foundations to applications. We first discuss general reasons for the popularity of deep learning, including several major breakthroughs in computer science. Next, we start reviewing the fundamental basics of the perceptron and neural networks, along with some fundamental theory that is often omitted. Doing so allows us to understand the reasons for the rise of deep learning in many application domains. Obviously medical image processing is one of these areas which has been largely affected by this rapid progress, in particular in image detection and recognition, image segmentation, image registration, and computer-aided diagnosis. There are also recent trends in physical simulation, modeling, and reconstruction that have led to astonishing results. Yet, some of these approaches neglect prior knowledge and hence bear the risk of producing implausible results. These apparent weaknesses highlight current limitations of deep ()learning. However, we also briefly discuss promising approaches that might be able to resolve these problems in the future.

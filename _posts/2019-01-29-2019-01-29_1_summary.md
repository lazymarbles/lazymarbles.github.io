*abstract:* Neuroscience has a long history of inferring brain function by examining the relationship between brain injury and subsequent behavioral impairments. The primary advantage of this method over correlative methods is that it can tell us if a certain brain region is necessary for a given cognitive function. In addition, lesion-based analyses provide unique insights into clinical deficits. In the last decade, statistical voxel-based lesion behavior mapping (VLBM) emerged as a powerful method for understanding the architecture of the human brain. This review illustrates how VLBM improves our knowledge of functional brain architecture, as well as how it is inherently limited by its mass-univariate approach. A wide array of recently developed methods appear to supplement traditional VLBM. This paper provides an overview of these new methods, including the use of specialized imaging modalities, the combination of structural imaging with normative connectome data, as well as multivariate analyses of structural imaging data. We see these new methods as complementing rather than replacing traditional VLBM, providing synergistic tools to answer related questions. Finally, we discuss the potential for these methods to become established in cognitive neuroscience and in clinical applications.

#### [32. A gentle introduction to deep learning in medical image processing.](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0939-3889(18)30120-X){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Maier Andreas, Syben Christopher, Lasser Tobias, Riess Christian*

**Journal:** *Zeitschrift fur medizinische Physik*

*abstract:* This paper tries to give a gentle introduction to deep learning in medical image processing, proceeding from theoretical foundations to applications. We first discuss general reasons for the popularity of deep learning, including several major breakthroughs in computer science. Next, we start reviewing the fundamental basics of the perceptron and neural networks, along with some fundamental theory that is often omitted. Doing so allows us to understand the reasons for the rise of deep learning in many application domains. Obviously medical image processing is one of these areas which has been largely affected by this rapid progress, in particular in image detection and recognition, image segmentation, image registration, and computer-aided diagnosis. There are also recent trends in physical simulation, modeling, and reconstruction that have led to astonishing results. Yet, some of these approaches neglect prior knowledge and hence bear the risk of producing implausible results. These apparent weaknesses highlight current limitations of deep ()learning. However, we also briefly discuss promising approaches that might be able to resolve these problems in the future.

**Authors:** *McCoy Thomas H*

**Journal:** *Psychosomatics*

*abstract:* Delirium is an acute confusional state, associated with morbidity and mortality in diverse medically-ill populations. Delirium is recognized, through both professional competencies and instructional materials, as a core topic in consultation psychiatry.

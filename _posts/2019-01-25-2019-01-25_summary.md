## 2. Bridging large-scale neuronal recordings and large-scale network models using dimensionality reduction.


*Journal: Current opinion in neurobiology* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-21*

[https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0959-4388(18)30134-X](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0959-4388(18)30134-X){: .btn}

*abstract:* A long-standing goal in neuroscience has been to bring together neuronal recordings and neural network modeling to understand brain function. Neuronal recordings can inform the development of network models, and network models can in turn provide predictions for subsequent experiments. Traditionally, neuronal recordings and network models have been related using single-neuron and pairwise spike train statistics. We review here recent studies that have begun to relate neuronal recordings and network models based on the multi-dimensional structure of neuronal population activity, as identified using dimensionality reduction. This approach has been used to study working memory, decision making, motor control, and more. Dimensionality reduction has provided common ground for incisive comparisons and tight interplay between neuronal recordings and network models.

**Keywords:** **"Alzheimer's disease", 'Brain connectivity', 'Conductance', 'Diffusion MRI', 'Resting-state functional MRI'**

*Journal: NeuroImage* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-21*

[https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1053-8119(19)30033-3](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1053-8119(19)30033-3){: .btn}

*abstract:* Connectomics has proved promising in quantifying and understanding the effects of development, aging and an array of diseases on the brain. In this work, we propose a new structural connectivity measure from diffusion MRI that allows us to incorporate direct brain connections, as well as indirect ones that would not be otherwise accounted for by standard techniques and that may be key for the better understanding of function from structure. From our experiments on the Human Connectome Project dataset, we find that our measure of structural connectivity better correlates with functional connectivity than streamline tractography does, meaning that it provides new structural information related to function. Through additional experiments on the ADNI-2 dataset, we demonstrate the ability of this new measure to better discriminate different stages of Alzheimer's disease. Our findings suggest that this measure is useful in the study of the normal brain structure, and for quantifying the effects of disease on the brain structure.

## 5. Novel genetic and epigenetic factors of importance for inter-individual differences in drug disposition, response and toxicity.


*Journal: Pharmacology & therapeutics* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-21*

[https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0163-7258(19)30008-7](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0163-7258(19)30008-7){: .btn}

*abstract:* Individuals differ substantially in their response to pharmacological treatment. Personalized medicine aspires to embrace these inter-individual differences and customize therapy by taking a wealth of patient-specific data into account. Pharmacogenomic constitutes a cornerstone of personalized medicine that provides therapeutic guidance based on the genomic profile of a given patient. Pharmacogenomics already has applications in the clinics, particularly in oncology, whereas future development in this area is needed in order to establish pharmacogenomic biomarkers as useful clinical tools. In this review we present an updated overview of current and emerging pharmacogenomic biomarkers in different therapeutic areas and critically discuss their potential to transform clinical care. Furthermore, we discuss opportunities of technological, methodological and institutional advances to improve biomarker discovery. We also summarize recent progress in our understanding of epigenetic effects on drug disposition and response, including a discussion of the only few pharmacogenomic biomarkers implemented into routine care. We anticipate, in part due to exciting rapid developments in Next Generation Sequencing technologies, machine learning methods and national biobanks, that the field will make great advances in the upcoming years towards unlocking the full potential of genomic data.

## 6. Low-Temperature Side Contact to Carbon Nanotube Transistors: Resistance Distributions Down to 10 nm Contact Length.
**Keywords:** **'Carbon nanotube field-effect transistor', 'beyond Si', 'contact resistance', 'scaled transistor', 'side contact', 'variations'**

*Journal: Nano letters* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-31*

[https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.nanolett.8b04370](https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.nanolett.8b04370){: .btn}

*abstract:* Carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNFETs) promise to improve the energy efficiency, speed, and transistor density of very large scale integration circuits owing to the intrinsic thin channel body and excellent charge transport properties of carbon nanotubes. Low-temperature fabrication (e.g., <400 °C) is a key enabler for the monolithic three-dimensional (3D) integration of CNFET digital logic into a device technology platform that overcomes memory bandwidth bottlenecks for data-abundant applications such as big-data analytics and machine learning. However, high contact resistance for short CNFET contacts has been a major roadblock to establishing CNFETs as a viable technology because the contact resistance, in series with the channel resistance, reduces the on-state current of CNFETs. Additionally, the variation in contact resistance remains unstudied for short contacts and will further degrade the energy efficiency and speed of CNFET circuits. In this work, we investigate by experiments the contact resistance and statistical variation of room-temperature fabricated CNFET contacts down to 10 nm contact lengths. These CNFET contacts are ∼15 nm shorter than the state-of-the-art Si CMOS "7 nm node" contact length, allowing for multiple generations of future scaling of the transistor-contacted gate pitch. For the 10 nm contacts, we report contact resistance values down to 6.5 kΩ per source/drain contact for a single carbon nanotube (CNT) with a median contact resistance of 18.2 kΩ. The 10 nm contacts reduce the CNFET current by as little as 13% at V

## 7. A library-based LAMMPS implementation of high-dimensional neural network potentials.


*Journal: Journal of chemical theory and computation* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-24*



*abstract:* Neural networks and other machine learning approaches have been successfully used to accurately represent atomic interaction potentials derived from computationally demanding electronic structure calculations. Due to their low computational cost, such representations open the possibility for large scale reactive molecular dynamics simulations of processes with bonding situations that cannot be described accurately with traditional empirical force fields. Here, we present a library of functions developed for the implementation of neural network potentials. Written in C++, this library incorporates several strategies resulting in a very high efficiency of neural network potential-energy and force evaluations. Based on this library, we have developed an implementation of the neural network potential within the molecular dynamics package LAMMPS and demonstrate its performance using liquid water as a test system.

## 9. An ensemble classification of exudates in color fundus images using an evolutionary algorithm based optimal features selection.
**Keywords:** **'diabetic retinopathy', 'exudates', 'fovea', 'macula', 'optic disc'**

*Journal: Microscopy research and technique* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-24*



*abstract:* Atomic recognition of the Exudates (EXs), the major symbol of diabetic retinopathy is essential for automated retinal images analysis. In this article, we proposed a novel machine learning technique for early detection and classification of EXs in color fundus images. The major challenge observed in the classification technique is the selection of optimal features to reduce computational time and space complexity and to provide a high degree of classification accuracy. To address these challenges, this article proposed an evolutionary algorithm based solution for optimal feature selection, which accelerates the classification process and reduces computational complexity. Similarly, three well-known classifiers that is, Naïve Bayes classifier, Support Vector Machine, and Artificial Neural Network are used for the classification of EXs. Moreover, an ensemble-based classifier is used for the selection of best classifier on the basis of majority voting technique. Experiments are performed on three well-known benchmark datasets and a real dataset developed at local Hospital. It has been observed that the proposed technique achieved an accuracy of 98% in the detection and classification of EXs in color fundus images.

## 10. Instanton rate constant calculations using interpolated potential energy surfaces in nonredundant, rotationally and translationally invariant coordinates.
**Keywords:** **'atom tunneling', 'instanton theory', 'machine learning', 'neural networks', 'reaction rate'**

*Journal: Journal of computational chemistry* *Publication Date: 2019-Mar-15*

[https://doi.org/10.1002/jcc.25770](https://doi.org/10.1002/jcc.25770){: .btn}

*abstract:* A trivial flaw in the utilization of artificial neural networks in interpolating chemical potential energy surfaces (PES) whose descriptors are Cartesian coordinates is their dependence on simple translations and rotations of the molecule under consideration. A different set of descriptors can be chosen to circumvent this problem, internuclear distances, inverse internuclear distances or z-matrix coordinates are three such descriptors. The objective is to use an interpolated PES in instanton rate constant calculations, hence information on the energy, gradient, and Hessian is required at coordinates in the vicinity of the tunneling path. Instanton theory relies on smoothly fitted Hessians, therefore we use energy, gradients, and Hessians in the training procedure. A major challenge is presented in the proper back-transformation of the output gradients and Hessians from internal coordinates to Cartesian coordinates. We perform comparisons between our method, a previous approach and on-the-fly rate constant calcuations on the hydrogen abstraction from methanol and on the hydrogen addition to isocyanic acid. © 2018Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

## 11. Technical Note: Design and Implementation of a High Throughput Pipeline for Reconstruction and Quantitative Analysis of CT Image Data.


*Journal: Medical physics* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-24*

[https://doi.org/10.1002/mp.13401](https://doi.org/10.1002/mp.13401){: .btn}

*abstract:* With recent substantial improvements in modern computing, interest in quantitative imaging with CT has seen a dramatic increase. As a result, the need to both create and analyze large, high-quality datasets of clinical studies has increased as well. At present, no efficient, widely-available method exists to accomplish this. The purpose of this technical note is to describe an open-source high-throughput computational pipeline framework for the reconstruction and analysis of diagnostic CT imaging data to conduct large-scale quantitative imaging studies and to accelerate and improve quantitative imaging research.

## 12. Kinetic and thermodynamic insights into sodium ion translocation through the μ-opioid receptor from molecular dynamics and machine learning analysis.


*Journal: PLoS computational biology* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-24*

[http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006689](http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006689){: .btn}

*abstract:* The differential modulation of agonist and antagonist binding to opioid receptors (ORs) by sodium (Na+) has been known for decades. To shed light on the molecular determinants, thermodynamics, and kinetics of Na+ translocation through the μ-OR (MOR), we used a multi-ensemble Markov model framework combining equilibrium and non-equilibrium atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of Na+ binding to MOR active or inactive crystal structures embedded in an explicit lipid bilayer. We identify an energetically favorable, continuous ion pathway through the MOR active conformation only, and provide, for the first time: i) estimates of the energy differences and required timescales of Na+ translocation in inactive and active MORs, ii) estimates of Na+-induced changes to agonist binding validated by radioligand measurements, and iii) testable hypotheses of molecular determinants and correlated motions involved in this translocation, which are likely to play a key role in MOR signaling.

## 13. Predicting survival from colorectal cancer histology slides using deep learning: A retrospective multicenter study.


*Journal: PLoS medicine* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan*

*abstract:* For virtually every patient with colorectal cancer (CRC), hematoxylin-eosin (HE)-stained tissue slides are available. These images contain quantitative information, which is not routinely used to objectively extract prognostic biomarkers. In the present study, we investigated whether deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can extract prognosticators directly from these widely available images.

## 14. Deep Learning: Current and Emerging Applications in Medicine and Technology.


*Journal: IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-23*

[https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2019.2894713](https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2019.2894713){: .btn}

*abstract:* Machine learning is enabling researchers to analyze and understand increasingly complex physical and biological phenomena in traditional fields such as biology, medicine, and engineering and emerging fields like synthetic biology, automated chemical synthesis, and bio-manufacturing. These fields require new paradigms towards understanding increasingly complex data and converting such data into medical products and services for patients. The move towards deep learning and complex modeling is an attempt to bridge the gap between acquiring massive quantities of complex data, and converting such data into practical insights. Here, we provide an overview of the field of machine learning, its current applications and needs in traditional and emerging fields, and discuss an illustrative attempt at using deep learning to understand swarm behavior of molecular shuttles.

## 15. Improving Prediction Performance Using Hierarchical Analysis of Real-Time Data: A Sepsis Case Study.


*Journal: IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-23*

[https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2019.2894570](https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2019.2894570){: .btn}

*abstract:* This paper presents a novel method for hierarchical analysis of machine learning algorithms to improve predictions of at risk patients, thus further enabling prompt therapy. Specifically, we develop a multi-layer machine learning approach to analyze continuous, high-frequency data. We illustrate the capabilities of this approach for early identification of patients at risk of sepsis, a potentially life-threatening complication of an infection, using high-frequency (minute-by-minute) physiological data collected from bedside monitors. In our analysis of a cohort of 586 patients, the model obtained from analyzing the output of a previously developed sepsis prediction model resulted in improved outcomes. Specifically, the original model failed to predict 11.76 ± 4.26% of sepsis patients earlier than Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) criteria, commonly used to identify patients at risk for rapid physiological deterioration resulting from sepsis. In contrast, the multi-layer model only failed to predict 3.21 ± 3.11% of sepsis patients earlier than SIRS. In addition, sepsis patients were predicted on average 204.87 ± 7.90 minutes earlier than SIRS criteria using the multi-layer model, which can potentially help reduce mortality and morbidity if implemented in the ICU.

## 16. Graph-based Hub Gene Selection Technique using Protein Interaction Information: Application to Sample Classification.


*Journal: IEEE journal of biomedical and health informatics* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-21*

[https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2019.2894374](https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/JBHI.2019.2894374){: .btn}

*abstract:* Classification of samples of gene expression profile plays a significant role in prediction and diagnosis of diseases. In the task of sample classification, a robust feature selection algorithm is very much essential to identify the important genes from the high dimensional gene expression data. This paper explores the information of protein-protein interaction (PPI) with a graph mining technique for finding a proper subset of features (genes), which further takes part in sample classification. Here, our contribution for feature selection is three-fold: first, all the genes are grouped into different clusters based on the integrated information of the gene expression values and their protein interactions using a multi-objective optimization (MOO) based clustering approach. Secondly, the confidence scores of the protein-protein interactions are incorporated in a popular graph mining algorithm namely Goldberg algorithm to find out the relevant features. These features are the topologically and functionally significant genes, named as hub genes. Finally, these hub genes are identified varying the degrees of the nodes, and those are utilized for the sample classification task. Different machine learning classifiers are exploited for this purpose, and the classification performance is measured with respect to various performance metrics namely accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F-measure and Mathews coefficient correlation (MCC). Comparative analysis with respect to two baselines and several existing approaches proves the efficiency of the proposed approach. Further, the robustness of the identified hub-gene modules is endorsed using some strong biological significance analysis.

## 17. A Data-driven Approach to Predict and Classify Epileptic Seizures from Brain-wide Calcium Imaging Video Data.


*Journal: IEEE/ACM transactions on computational biology and bioinformatics* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-24*

[https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TCBB.2019.2895077](https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TCBB.2019.2895077){: .btn}

*abstract:* The prediction of epileptic seizures has been an essential problem of epilepsy study. The calcium imaging video data images the whole brain-wide neurons activities with electrical discharge recorded by calcium fluorescence intensity (CFI). In this paper, using the zebrafish's brain-wide calcium image video data, we propose a data-driven approach to effectively detect the systemic change-point, and further predict the epileptic seizures. Our approach includes two phases: offline training and online testing. Specifically, during offline training, we extract features and confirm the existence of systemic change-point, then estimate the ratio of unchanged system duration to interictal period duration. For online testing, we implement a statistical model to estimate the change-point, and then predict the onset of epileptic seizure. The testing results show that our proposed approach could effectively predict the time range of future epileptic seizure. Furthermore, we explore the macroscopic patterns of epileptic and control cases, and extract features based on the pattern difference, then implement and compare the classification performance from four machine learning models. Based on the data structure, we also propose a new method to discretize related features, and combine with hierarchical clustering to better visualize and explain the pattern difference between epileptic and control cases.

## 18. Mutual Component Convolutional Neural Networks for Heterogeneous Face Recognition.


*Journal: IEEE transactions on image processing : a publication of the IEEE Signal Processing Society* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-23*

[https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2019.2894272](https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TIP.2019.2894272){: .btn}

*abstract:* HHeterogeneous face recognition (HFR) aims to identify a person from different facial modalities such as visible and near-infrared images. The main challenges of HFR lie in the large modality discrepancy and insufficient training samples. In this paper, we propose the Mutual Component Convolutional Neural Network (MC-CNN), a modal-invariant deep learning framework, to tackle these two issues simultaneously. Our MCCNN incorporates a generative module, i.e. the Mutual Component Analysis (MCA) [1], into modern deep convolutional neural networks by viewing MCA as a special fully-connected (FC) layer. Based on deep features, this FC layer is designed to extract modal-independent hidden factors, and is updated according to maximum likelihood analytic formulation instead of back propagation which prevents over-fitting from limited data naturally. In addition, we develop an MCA loss to update the network for modal-invariant feature learning. Extensive experiments show that our MC-CNN outperforms several finetuned baseline models significantly. Our methods achieve the state-of-the-art performance on CASIA NIR-VIS 2.0, CUHK NIR-VIS and IIIT-D Sketch dataset.

## 19. Lung and Pancreatic Tumor Characterization in the Deep Learning Era: Novel Supervised and Unsupervised Learning Approaches.


*Journal: IEEE transactions on medical imaging* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-23*

[https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2019.2894349](https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2019.2894349){: .btn}

*abstract:* Risk stratification (characterization) of tumors from radiology images can be more accurate and faster with computeraided diagnosis (CAD) tools. Tumor characterization through such tools can also enable non-invasive cancer staging, prognosis, and foster personalized treatment planning as a part of precision medicine. In this study, we propose both supervised and unsupervised machine learning strategies to improve tumor characterization. Our first approach is based on supervised learning for which we demonstrate significant gains with deep learning algorithms, particularly by utilizing a 3D Convolutional Neural Network and Transfer Learning. Motivated by the radiologists' interpretations of the scans, we then show how to incorporate task dependent feature representations into a CAD system via a graph-regularized sparse Multi-Task Learning (MTL) framework. In the second approach, we explore an unsupervised learning algorithm to address the limited availability of labeled training data, a common problem in medical imaging applications. Inspired by learning from label proportion (LLP) approaches in computer vision, we propose to use proportion-SVM for characterizing tumors. We also seek the answer to the fundamental question about the goodness of "deep features" for unsupervised tumor classification. We evaluate our proposed supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms on two different tumor diagnosis challenges: lung and pancreas with 1018 CT and 171 MRI scans, respectively, and obtain the state-of-the-art sensitivity and specificity results in both problems.

## 20. Automatic 3D bi-ventricular segmentation of cardiac images by a shape-refined multi-task deep learning approach.


*Journal: IEEE transactions on medical imaging* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-23*

[https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2019.2894322](https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2019.2894322){: .btn}

*abstract:* Deep learning approaches have achieved state-of-the-art performance in cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) image segmentation. However, most approaches have focused on learning image intensity features for segmentation, whereas the incorporation of anatomical shape priors has received less attention. In this paper, we combine a multi-task deep learning approach with atlas propagation to develop a shape-refined bi-ventricular segmentation pipeline for short-axis CMR volumetric images. The pipeline first employs a fully convolutional network (FCN) that learns segmentation and landmark localisation tasks simultaneously. The architecture of the proposed FCN uses a 2.5D representation, thus combining the computational advantage of 2D FCNs networks and the capability of addressing 3D spatial consistency without compromising segmentation accuracy. Moreover, a refinement step is designed to explicitly impose shape prior knowledge and improve segmentation quality. This step is effective for overcoming image artefacts (e.g. due to different breath-hold positions and large slice thickness), which preclude the creation of anatomically meaningful 3D cardiac shapes. The pipeline is fully automated, due to network's ability to infer landmarks, which are then used downstream in the pipeline to initialise atlas propagation. We validate the pipeline on 1831 healthy subjects and 649 subjects with pulmonary hypertension. Extensive numerical experiments on the two datasets demonstrate that our proposed method is robust and capable of producing accurate, high-resolution and anatomically smooth bi-ventricular 3D models, despite the presence of artefacts in input CMR volumes.

## 23. Machine learning in multiexposure laser speckle contrast imaging can replace conventional laser Doppler flowmetry.
**Keywords:** **'artificial neural networks', 'blood flow', 'laser speckle contrast analysis', 'microcirculation'**

*Journal: Journal of biomedical optics* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan*



*abstract:* Laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) enables video rate imaging of blood flow. However, its relation to tissue blood perfusion is nonlinear and depends strongly on exposure time. By contrast, the perfusion estimate from the slower laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) technique has a relationship to blood perfusion that is better understood. Multiexposure LSCI (MELSCI) enables a perfusion estimate closer to the actual perfusion than that using a single exposure time. We present and evaluate a method that utilizes contrasts from seven exposure times between 1 and 64 ms to calculate a perfusion estimate that resembles the perfusion estimate from LDF. The method is based on artificial neural networks (ANN) for fast and accurate processing of MELSCI contrasts to perfusion. The networks are trained using modeling of Doppler histograms and speckle contrasts from tissue models. The importance of accounting for noise is demonstrated. Results show that by using ANN, MELSCI data can be processed to LDF perfusion with high accuracy, with a correlation coefficient R  =  1.000 for noise-free data, R  =  0.993 when a moderate degree of noise is present, and R  =  0.995 for in vivo data from an occlusion-release experiment.

## 24. Diagnosis of mesothelioma with deep learning.
**Keywords:** **'deep learning', 'diagnosis', 'malignant mesothelioma', 'stacked sparse autoencoder'**

*Journal: Oncology letters* *Publication Date: 2019-Feb*



*abstract:* Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is a rare but aggressive cancer. The definitive diagnosis of MM is critical for effective treatment and has important medicolegal significance. However, the definitive diagnosis of MM is challenging due to its composite epithelial/mesenchymal pattern. The aim of the current study was to develop a deep learning method to automatically diagnose MM. A retrospective analysis of 324 participants with or without MM was performed. Significant features were selected using a genetic algorithm (GA) or a ReliefF algorithm performed in MATLAB software. Subsequently, the current study constructed and trained several models based on a backpropagation (BP) algorithm, extreme learning machine algorithm and stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) to diagnose MM. A confusion matrix, F-measure and a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were used to evaluate the performance of each model. A total of 34 potential variables were analyzed, while the GA and ReliefF algorithms selected 19 and 5 effective features, respectively. The selected features were used as the inputs of the three models. SSAE and GA+SSAE demonstrated the highest performance in terms of classification accuracy, specificity, F-measure and the area under the ROC curve. Overall, the GA+SSAE model was the preferred model since it required a shorter CPU time and fewer variables. Therefore, the SSAE with GA feature selection was selected as the most accurate model for the diagnosis of MM. The deep learning methods developed based on the GA+SSAE model may assist physicians with the diagnosis of MM.

## 25. A Reweighted Scheme to Improve the Representation of the Neural Autoregressive Distribution Estimator.


*Journal: Computational intelligence and neuroscience* *Publication Date: 2018*

[https://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/6401645](https://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/6401645){: .btn}

*abstract:* The neural autoregressive distribution estimator(NADE) is a competitive model for the task of density estimation in the field of machine learning. While NADE mainly focuses on the problem of estimating density, the ability for dealing with other tasks remains to be improved. In this paper, we introduce a simple and efficient reweighted scheme to modify the parameters of the learned NADE. We make use of the structure of NADE, and the weights are derived from the activations in the corresponding hidden layers. The experiments show that the features from unsupervised learning with our reweighted scheme would be more meaningful, and the performance of the initialization for neural networks has a significant improvement as well.

*abstract:* Despite the successful progress next-generation sequencing technologies has achieved in diagnosing the genetic cause of rare Mendelian diseases, the current diagnostic rate is still far from satisfactory because of heterogeneity, imprecision, and noise in disease phenotype descriptions and insufficient utilization of expert knowledge in clinical genetics. To overcome these difficulties, we present a novel method called Xrare for the prioritization of causative gene variants in rare disease diagnosis.

*abstract:* Head motion (HM) during fMRI acquisition can significantly affect measures of brain activity or connectivity even after correction with preprocessing methods. Moreover, any systematic relationship between HM and variables of interest can introduce systematic bias. There is a large and growing interest in identifying neural biomarkers for psychiatric disorders using resting state fMRI (rsfMRI). However, the relationship between HM and different psychiatric symptoms domains is not well understood. The aim of this investigation was to determine whether psychiatric symptoms and other characteristics of the individual predict HM during rsfMRI. A sample of n = 464 participants (174 male) from the Tulsa1000, a naturalistic longitudinal study recruiting subjects with different levels of severity in mood/anxiety/substance use disorders based on the dimensional NIMH Research Domain Criteria framework was used for this study. Based on a machine learning (ML) pipeline with nested cross-validation to avoid overfitting, the stacked model with 15 anthropometric (like body mass index, BMI) and demographic (age and sex) variables identifies BMI and weight as the most important variables and explained 10.9 percent of the HM variance (95% CI: 9.9-11.8). In comparison ML models with 105 self-report measures for state and trait psychological characteristics identified nicotine and alcohol use variables as well as impulsivity inhibitory control variables but explain only 5 percent of HM variance (95% CI: 3.5-6.4). A combined ML model using all 120 variables did not perform significantly better than the model using only 15 physical variables (combined model 95% confidence interval: 10.2-12.4). Taken together, after considering physical variables, state or trait psychological characteristics do not provide additional power to predict motion during rsfMRI.

## 28. Probabilistic Assessment of Glass Forming Ability Rules for Metallic Glasses Aided by Automated Analysis of Phase Diagrams.

*abstract:* The use of machine learning techniques to expedite the discovery and development of new materials is an essential step towards the acceleration of a new generation of domain-specific highly functional material systems. In this paper, we use the test case of bulk metallic glasses to highlight the key issues in the field of high throughput predictions and propose a new probabilistic analysis of rules for glass forming ability using rough set theory. This approach has been applied to a broad range of binary alloy compositions in order to predict new metallic glass compositions. Our data driven approach takes into account not only a broad variety of thermodynamic, structural and kinetic based criteria, but also incorporates qualitative and descriptive attributes associated with eutectic points in phase diagrams. For the latter, we demonstrate the use of automated machine learning methods that go far beyond text recognition approaches by also being able to interpret phase diagrams. When combined with structural descriptors, this approach provides the foundations to develop a hierarchical probabilistic predication tool that can rank the feasibility of glass formation.

*abstract:* Lysine acetylation in protein is one of the most important post-translational modifications (PTMs). It plays an important role in essential biological processes and is related to various diseases. To obtain a comprehensive understanding of regulatory mechanism of lysine acetylation, the key is to identify lysine acetylation sites. Previously, several shallow machine learning algorithms had been applied to predict lysine modification sites in proteins. However, shallow machine learning has some disadvantages. For instance, it is not as effective as deep learning for processing big data.

*abstract:* Over the past decades, peptide as a therapeutic candidate has received increasing attention in drug discovery, especially for antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), anticancer peptides (ACPs) and anti-inflammatory peptides (AIPs). It is considered that the peptides can regulate various complex diseases which are previously untouchable. In recent years, the critical problem of antimicrobial resistance drives the pharmaceutical industry to look for new therapeutic agents. Comparing to organic small drugs, peptide-based therapy exhibits high specificity and minimal toxicity. Thus, peptides are widely recruited in the design and discovery of new potent drugs. Currently, large-scale screening of peptide activity with traditional approaches is costly, time-consuming and labor intensive. Hence, in silico methods, mainly machine learning approaches, for their accuracy and effectiveness, have been introduced to predict the peptide activity. In this review, we document the recent progress in machine learning-based prediction of peptides which will be of great benefit to the discovery of potential active AMPs, ACPs and AIPs.

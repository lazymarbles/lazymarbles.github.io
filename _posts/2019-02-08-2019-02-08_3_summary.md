**Authors:** *Allard Tony, Alvino Paul, Shing Leslie, Wollaber Allan, Yuen Joseph*

**Journal:** *PloS one*

*abstract:* Data sets that provide a ground truth to quantify the efficacy of automated algorithms are rare due to the time consuming and expensive, although highly valuable, task of manually annotating observations. These datasets exist for niche problems in developed fields such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Business Process Mining (BPM), however it is difficult to find a suitable dataset for use cases that span across multiple fields, such as the one described in this study. The lack of established ground truth maps between cyberspace and the human-interpretable, persona-driven tasks that occur therein, is one of the principal barriers preventing reliable, automated situation awareness of dynamically evolving events and the consequences of loss due to cybersecurity breaches. Automated workflow analysis-the machine-learning assisted identification of templates of repeated tasks-is the likely missing link between semantic descriptions of mission goals and observable events in cyberspace. We summarize our efforts to establish a ground truth for an email dataset pertaining to the operation of an open source software project. The ground truth defines semantic labels for each email and the arrangement of emails within a sequence that describe actions observed in the dataset. Identified sequences are then used to define template workflows that describe the possible tasks undertaken for a project and their business process model. We present the overall purpose of the dataset, the methodology for establishing a ground truth, and lessons learned from the effort. Finally, we report on the proposed use of the dataset for the workflow discovery problem, and its effect on system accuracy.

**Authors:** *Nelson Erik, Fitzgerald John, Tefft Nathan*

**Journal:** *PloS one*

*abstract:* Consumer spending on organic food products has grown rapidly. Some claim that organics have ecological, equity, and health advantages over conventional food and therefore should be subsidized. Here we explore the distributive impacts of an organic fruit subsidy that reduces the retail price of organic fruit in the US by 10 percent. We estimate the impact of the subsidy on organic fruit demand in a representative poor, middle income, and rich US household using three analytical methods; including two econometric and one machine learning. We do not find strong evidence of regressive redistribution due to our simulated organic fruit subsidy; the poor household's relative reaction to the subsidy is not much different than the reaction at the other two households. However, the infra-marginal savings from the subsidy tend to be larger in richer households.

*abstract:* Precision medicine is the future of health care: please watch the animation at https://vimeo.com/241154708 . As a technology-intensive and -dependent medical discipline, oncology will be at the vanguard of this impending change. However, to bring about precision medicine, a fundamental conundrum must be solved: Human cognitive capacity, typically constrained to five variables for decision making in the context of the increasing number of available biomarkers and therapeutic options, is a limiting factor to the realization of precision medicine. Given this level of complexity and the restriction of human decision making, current methods are untenable. A solution to this challenge is multifactorial decision support systems (DSSs), continuously learning artificial intelligence platforms that integrate all available data-clinical, imaging, biologic, genetic, cost-to produce validated predictive models. DSSs compare the personalized probable outcomes-toxicity, tumor control, quality of life, cost effectiveness-of various care pathway decisions to ensure optimal efficacy and economy. DSSs can be integrated into the workflows both strategically (at the multidisciplinary tumor board level to support treatment choice, eg, surgery or radiotherapy) and tactically (at the specialist level to support treatment technique, eg, prostate spacer or not). In some countries, the reimbursement of certain treatments, such as proton therapy, is already conditional on the basis that a DSS is used. DSSs have many stakeholders-clinicians, medical directors, medical insurers, patient advocacy groups-and are a natural consequence of big data in health care. Here, we provide an overview of DSSs, their challenges, opportunities, and capacity to improve clinical decision making, with an emphasis on the utility in oncology.

#### 4. Feature Engineering for Materials Chemistry - Does Size Matter?
No LinkOut links available for UID: 30730732

**Authors:** *Amos Roger Duncan, Kobayashi Rika*

**Journal:** *Journal of chemical information and modeling*

*abstract:* The effects of structural featurisers in the prediction of band gaps have been investigated through machine learning by application to a silver nanoparticle dataset and 2254 potential light-harvesting materials with known band gap. Elemental properties were extended with structural features, via Voronoi polyhedra which allows for neighbour effects, so presumably giving a better representation of the extended system. However, we did not find any noticeably significant difference to the predictive performance of our model. The biggest improvement to our model was from including band gaps calculated from density functional theory. This resulted in a model which could predict the band gaps of the 2254 light-harvesting dataset with an accuracy reflected in a root-mean-square error of 0.232 eV and mean absolute error of 0.142 eV. Furthermore, the good performance of our model was transferable to the prediction of a set of 72 experimental band gaps, independent of the training set, giving a root-mean-square error of 0.91 eV and mean absolute error of 0.76 eV.

**Journal:** *Journal of chemical information and modeling*

*abstract:* Binding prediction between targets and drug-like compounds through Deep Neural Networks have generated promising results in recent years, outperforming traditional machine learning-based methods. However, the generalization capability of these classification models is still an issue to be addressed. In this work, we explored how different cross-validation strategies applied to data from different molecular databases affect to the performance of binding prediction proteochemometrics models. These strategies are: (1) random splitting, (2) splitting based on K-means clustering (both of actives and inactives), (3) splitting based on source database and (4) splitting based both in the clustering and in the source database. These schemas are applied to a Deep Learning proteochemometrics model and to a simple logistic regression model to be used as baseline. Additionally, two different ways of describing molecules in the model are tested: (1) by their SMILES and (2) by three fingerprints. The classification performance of our Deep Learning-based proteochemometrics model is comparable to the state of the art. Our results show that the lack of generalization of these models is due to a bias in public molecular databases and that a restrictive cross-validation schema based on compounds clustering leads to worse but more robust and credible results. Our results also show better performance when representing molecules by their fingerprints.

**Authors:** *Gao Shuang, Liu Gang, Yang Huali, Hu Chao, Chen Qilai, Gong Guodong, Xue Wuhong, Yi Xiaohui, Shang Jie, Li Run-Wei*

**Journal:** *ACS nano*

*abstract:* The rapid development of artificial intelligence techniques and future advanced robot systems sparks emergent demand on the accurate perception and understanding of the external environments via visual sensing systems that can co-locate the self-adaptive detecting, processing and memorizing of optical signals. In this contribution, a simple indium-tin oxide/Nb-doped SrTiO3 (ITO/Nb:SrTiO3) heterojunction artificial optoelectronic synapse is proposed and demonstrated. Through the light and electric field co-modulation of the Schottky barrier profile at the ITO/Nb:SrTiO3 interface, the oxide heterojunction device can respond to the entire visible light region in a neuromorphic manner, allowing synaptic paired-pulse facilitation, short/long-term memory and "learning-experience" behavior for optical information manipulation. More importantly, the photo-plasticity of the artificial synapse has been modulated by hetero-synaptic means with a sub-1 V external voltage, not only enabling an optoelectronic analog of the mechanical aperture device showing adaptive and stable optical perception capability under different illuminating conditions, but also making the artificial synapse suitable for the mimicry of interest-modulated human visual memories.

No LinkOut links available for UID: 30730601

**Authors:** *Schneider Gisbert, Clark David E*

**Journal:** *Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English)*

*abstract:* Medicinal chemistry and in particular "drug design" have often been perceived as more of an art than science. The many unknowns of human disease and the sheer complexity of chemical space render decision making in medicinal chemistry exceptionally demanding. Computational models can assist the medicinal chemist in this endeavour. Here, we provide an overview of recent examples of automated de novo molecular design, discuss the concepts and computational approaches involved, and dare to predict some of the possibilities and limitations of drug design with machine intelligence.

**Authors:** *Karnuta Jaret M, Navarro Sergio M, Haeberle Heather S, Billow Damien G, Krebs Viktor E, Ramkumar Prem N*

**Journal:** *Journal of orthopaedic trauma*

*abstract:* With the transition to a value-based model of care delivery, bundled payment models have been implemented with demonstrated success in elective lower extremity joint arthroplasty. Yet, hip fracture outcomes are dependent on patient-level factors that may not be optimized pre-operatively due to acuity of care. The objectives of this study are to (1) develop a supervised Naïve Bayes machine-learning algorithm using pre-operative patient data to predict length of stay and cost after hip fracture and (2) propose a patient-specific payment model to project reimbursements based on patient comorbidities.

**Journal:** *JMIR mHealth and uHealth*

*abstract:* Time-resolved quantification of physical activity can contribute to both personalized medicine and epidemiological research studies, for example, managing and identifying triggers of asthma exacerbations. A growing number of reportedly accurate machine learning algorithms for human activity recognition (HAR) have been developed using data from wearable devices (eg, smartwatch and smartphone). However, many HAR algorithms depend on fixed-size sampling windows that may poorly adapt to real-world conditions in which activity bouts are of unequal duration. A small sliding window can produce noisy predictions under stable conditions, whereas a large sliding window may miss brief bursts of intense activity.

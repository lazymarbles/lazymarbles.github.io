*abstract:* Substantial alterations at the multi-omics level of pancreatic cancer (PC) impede the possibility to diagnose and treat patients in early stages. Herein, we conducted an integrative omics-based translational analysis, utilizing next-generation sequencing, transcriptome meta-analysis, and immunohistochemistry, combined with statistical learning, to validate multiplex biomarker candidates for the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of PC. Experiment-based validation was conducted and supportive evidence for the essentiality of the candidates in PC were found at gene expression or protein level by practical biochemical methods. Remarkably, the random forests (RF) model exhibited an excellent diagnostic performance and

*abstract:* The study aims to explore the spatial distribution of multi-tendinous muscle modulated by central nervous system (CNS) during sustained contraction. Nine subjects were recruited to trace constant target forces with right index finger extension. Surface electromyography (sEMG) of extensor digitorum (ED) were recorded with a 32-channel electrode array. Nine successive topographic maps (TM) were obtained. Pixel wise analysis was utilized to extract subtracted topographic maps (STM), which exhibited inhomogeneous distribution. STMs were characterized into hot, warm, and cool regions corresponding to higher, moderate, and lower change ranges, respectively. The relative normalized area (normalized to the first phase) of these regions demonstrated different changing trends as rising, plateauing, and falling over time, respectively. Moreover, the duration of these trends were found to be affected by force level. The rising/falling periods were longer at lower force levels, while the plateau can be achieved from the initial phase for higher force output (45% maximal voluntary contraction). The results suggested muscle activity reorganization in ED plays a role to maintain sustained contraction. Furthermore, the decreased dynamical regulation ability to spatial reorganization may be prone to induce fatigue. This finding implied that spatial reorganization of muscle activity as a regulation mechanism contribute to maintain constant force production.

*abstract:* Conservation researchers require low-cost access to acoustic monitoring technology. However, affordable tools are often constrained to short-term studies due to high energy consumption and limited storage. To enable long-term monitoring, energy and space efficiency must be improved on such tools. This paper describes the development and deployment of three acoustic detection algorithms that reduce the power and storage requirements of acoustic monitoring on affordable, open-source hardware. The algorithms aim to detect bat echolocation, to search for evidence of an endangered cicada species, and also to collect evidence of poaching in a protected nature reserve. The algorithms are designed to run on AudioMoth: a low-cost, open-source acoustic monitoring device, developed by the authors and widely adopted by the conservation community. Each algorithm addresses a detection task of increasing complexity, implementing extra analytical steps to account for environmental conditions such as wind, analysing samples multiple times to prevent missed events, and incorporating a hidden Markov model for sample classification in both the time and frequency domain. For each algorithm, we report on real-world deployments carried out with partner organisations and also benchmark the hidden Markov model against a convolutional neural network, a deep-learning technique commonly used for acoustics. The deployments demonstrate how acoustic detection algorithms extend the use of low-cost, open-source hardware and facilitate a new avenue for conservation researchers to perform large-scale monitoring.

*abstract:* Successful applications of brain-computer interface (BCI) approaches to motor imagery (MI) are still limited. In this paper, we propose a classification framework for MI electroencephalogram (EEG) signals that combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture with a variational autoencoder (VAE) for classification. The decoder of the VAE generates a Gaussian distribution, so it can be used to fit the Gaussian distribution of EEG signals. A new representation of input was developed by combining the time, frequency, and channel information from the EEG signal, and the CNN-VAE method was designed and optimized accordingly for this form of input. In this network, the classification of the extracted CNN features is performed via the deep network VAE. Our framework, with an average kappa value of 0.564, outperforms the best classification method in the literature for BCI Competition IV dataset 2b with a 3% improvement. Furthermore, using our own dataset, the CNN-VAE framework also yields the best performance for both three-electrode and five-electrode EEGs and achieves the best average kappa values 0.568 and 0.603, respectively. Our results show that the proposed CNN-VAE method raises performance to the current state of the art.

*abstract:* The recent success of small-molecule kinase inhibitors as anticancer drugs has generated significant interest in their application to other clinical areas, such as disorders of the central nervous system (CNS). However, most kinase inhibitor drug candidates investigated to date have been ineffective at treating CNS disorders, mainly due to poor blood⁻brain barrier (BBB) permeability. It is, therefore, imperative to evaluate new chemical entities for both kinase inhibition and BBB permeability. Over the last 35 years, marine biodiscovery has yielded 471 natural products reported as kinase inhibitors, yet very few have been evaluated for BBB permeability. In this study, we revisited these marine natural products and predicted their ability to cross the BBB by applying freely available open-source chemoinformatics and machine learning algorithms to a training set of 332 previously reported CNS-penetrant small molecules. We evaluated several regression and classification models, and found that our optimised classifiers (random forest, gradient boosting, and logistic regression) outperformed other models, with overall cross-validated model accuracies of 80%⁻82% and 78%⁻80% on external testing. All 3 binary classifiers predicted 13 marine-derived kinase inhibitors with appropriate physicochemical characteristics for BBB permeability.

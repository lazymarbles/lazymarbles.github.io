**Authors:** *Fredriksson Ingemar, Hultman Martin, Strömberg Tomas, Larsson Marcus*

**Journal:** *Journal of biomedical optics*

*abstract:* Laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) enables video rate imaging of blood flow. However, its relation to tissue blood perfusion is nonlinear and depends strongly on exposure time. By contrast, the perfusion estimate from the slower laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) technique has a relationship to blood perfusion that is better understood. Multiexposure LSCI (MELSCI) enables a perfusion estimate closer to the actual perfusion than that using a single exposure time. We present and evaluate a method that utilizes contrasts from seven exposure times between 1 and 64 ms to calculate a perfusion estimate that resembles the perfusion estimate from LDF. The method is based on artificial neural networks (ANN) for fast and accurate processing of MELSCI contrasts to perfusion. The networks are trained using modeling of Doppler histograms and speckle contrasts from tissue models. The importance of accounting for noise is demonstrated. Results show that by using ANN, MELSCI data can be processed to LDF perfusion with high accuracy, with a correlation coefficient R  =  1.000 for noise-free data, R  =  0.993 when a moderate degree of noise is present, and R  =  0.995 for in vivo data from an occlusion-release experiment.

**Authors:** *Hu Xue, Yu Zebo*

**Journal:** *Oncology letters*

*abstract:* Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is a rare but aggressive cancer. The definitive diagnosis of MM is critical for effective treatment and has important medicolegal significance. However, the definitive diagnosis of MM is challenging due to its composite epithelial/mesenchymal pattern. The aim of the current study was to develop a deep learning method to automatically diagnose MM. A retrospective analysis of 324 participants with or without MM was performed. Significant features were selected using a genetic algorithm (GA) or a ReliefF algorithm performed in MATLAB software. Subsequently, the current study constructed and trained several models based on a backpropagation (BP) algorithm, extreme learning machine algorithm and stacked sparse autoencoder (SSAE) to diagnose MM. A confusion matrix, F-measure and a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were used to evaluate the performance of each model. A total of 34 potential variables were analyzed, while the GA and ReliefF algorithms selected 19 and 5 effective features, respectively. The selected features were used as the inputs of the three models. SSAE and GA+SSAE demonstrated the highest performance in terms of classification accuracy, specificity, F-measure and the area under the ROC curve. Overall, the GA+SSAE model was the preferred model since it required a shorter CPU time and fewer variables. Therefore, the SSAE with GA feature selection was selected as the most accurate model for the diagnosis of MM. The deep learning methods developed based on the GA+SSAE model may assist physicians with the diagnosis of MM.

#### [25. A Reweighted Scheme to Improve the Representation of the Neural Autoregressive Distribution Estimator.](https://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/6401645){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Wang Zheng, Wu Qingbiao*

**Journal:** *Computational intelligence and neuroscience*

*abstract:* The neural autoregressive distribution estimator(NADE) is a competitive model for the task of density estimation in the field of machine learning. While NADE mainly focuses on the problem of estimating density, the ability for dealing with other tasks remains to be improved. In this paper, we introduce a simple and efficient reweighted scheme to modify the parameters of the learned NADE. We make use of the structure of NADE, and the weights are derived from the activations in the corresponding hidden layers. The experiments show that the features from unsupervised learning with our reweighted scheme would be more meaningful, and the performance of the initialization for neural networks has a significant improvement as well.

**Authors:** *Li Qigang, Zhao Keyan, Bustamante Carlos D, Ma Xin, Wong Wing H*

**Journal:** *Genetics in medicine : official journal of the American College of Medical Genetics*

*abstract:* Despite the successful progress next-generation sequencing technologies has achieved in diagnosing the genetic cause of rare Mendelian diseases, the current diagnostic rate is still far from satisfactory because of heterogeneity, imprecision, and noise in disease phenotype descriptions and insufficient utilization of expert knowledge in clinical genetics. To overcome these difficulties, we present a novel method called Xrare for the prioritization of causative gene variants in rare disease diagnosis.

#### [27. Physical characteristics not psychological state or trait characteristics predict motion during resting state fMRI.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-36699-0){: .btn}

*abstract:* Head motion (HM) during fMRI acquisition can significantly affect measures of brain activity or connectivity even after correction with preprocessing methods. Moreover, any systematic relationship between HM and variables of interest can introduce systematic bias. There is a large and growing interest in identifying neural biomarkers for psychiatric disorders using resting state fMRI (rsfMRI). However, the relationship between HM and different psychiatric symptoms domains is not well understood. The aim of this investigation was to determine whether psychiatric symptoms and other characteristics of the individual predict HM during rsfMRI. A sample of n = 464 participants (174 male) from the Tulsa1000, a naturalistic longitudinal study recruiting subjects with different levels of severity in mood/anxiety/substance use disorders based on the dimensional NIMH Research Domain Criteria framework was used for this study. Based on a machine learning (ML) pipeline with nested cross-validation to avoid overfitting, the stacked model with 15 anthropometric (like body mass index, BMI) and demographic (age and sex) variables identifies BMI and weight as the most important variables and explained 10.9 percent of the HM variance (95% CI: 9.9-11.8). In comparison ML models with 105 self-report measures for state and trait psychological characteristics identified nicotine and alcohol use variables as well as impulsivity inhibitory control variables but explain only 5 percent of HM variance (95% CI: 3.5-6.4). A combined ML model using all 120 variables did not perform significantly better than the model using only 15 physical variables (combined model 95% confidence interval: 10.2-12.4). Taken together, after considering physical variables, state or trait psychological characteristics do not provide additional power to predict motion during rsfMRI.

**Journal:** *Scientific reports*

*abstract:* The use of machine learning techniques to expedite the discovery and development of new materials is an essential step towards the acceleration of a new generation of domain-specific highly functional material systems. In this paper, we use the test case of bulk metallic glasses to highlight the key issues in the field of high throughput predictions and propose a new probabilistic analysis of rules for glass forming ability using rough set theory. This approach has been applied to a broad range of binary alloy compositions in order to predict new metallic glass compositions. Our data driven approach takes into account not only a broad variety of thermodynamic, structural and kinetic based criteria, but also incorporates qualitative and descriptive attributes associated with eutectic points in phase diagrams. For the latter, we demonstrate the use of automated machine learning methods that go far beyond text recognition approaches by also being able to interpret phase diagrams. When combined with structural descriptors, this approach provides the foundations to develop a hierarchical probabilistic predication tool that can rank the feasibility of glass formation.

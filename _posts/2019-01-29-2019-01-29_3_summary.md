*abstract:* Preoperative prediction of microvascular invasion (MVI) in patients with hepatocellular cancer (HCC) is important for surgery strategy making. We aimed to develop and validate a combined intratumoural and peritumoural radiomics model based on gadolinium-ethoxybenzyl-diethylenetriamine (Gd-EOB-DTPA)-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for preoperative prediction of MVI in primary HCC patients.

## 21. Nurses "Seeing Forest for the Trees" in the Age of Machine Learning: Using Nursing Knowledge to Improve Relevance and Performance.


*Journal: Computers, informatics, nursing : CIN* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-25*

[http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/CIN.0000000000000508](http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/CIN.0000000000000508){: .btn}

*abstract:* Although machine learning is increasingly being applied to support clinical decision making, there is a significant gap in understanding what it is and how nurses should adopt it in practice. The purpose of this case study is to show how one application of machine learning may support nursing work and to discuss how nurses can contribute to improving its relevance and performance. Using data from 130 specialized hospitals with 101 766 patients with diabetes, we applied various advanced statistical methods (known as machine learning algorithms) to predict early readmission. The best-performing machine learning algorithm showed modest predictive ability with opportunities for improvement. Nurses can contribute to machine learning algorithms by (1) filling data gaps with nursing-relevant data that provide personalized context about the patient, (2) improving data preprocessing techniques, and (3) evaluating potential value in practice. These findings suggest that nurses need to further process the information provided by machine learning and apply "Wisdom-in-Action" to make appropriate clinical decisions. Nurses play a pivotal role in ensuring that machine learning algorithms are shaped by their unique knowledge of each patient's personalized context. By combining machine learning with unique nursing knowledge, nurses can provide more visibility to nursing work, advance nursing science, and better individualize patient care. Therefore, to successfully integrate and maximize the benefits of machine learning, nurses must fully participate in its development, implementation, and evaluation.

## 22. HIV and age underlie specific patterns of brain abnormalities and cognitive changes in high functioning patients.


*Journal: Neuropsychology* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-28*



*abstract:* Findings on the influence of age and HIV on brain and cognition remain equivocal, particularly in aviremic subjects without other age or HIV-related comorbidities. We aimed to (a) examine the effect of HIV status and age on structural brain measurements and cognition, and (b) apply the machine learning technique to identify brain morphometric and cognitive features that are most discriminative between aviremic subjects with HIV on stable combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and healthy controls.

*abstract:* Data mining methods based on machine learning play an increasingly important role in drug design and discovery. In the current work, eight machine learning methods including decision trees, k-Nearest neighbor, support vector machines, random forests, extremely randomized trees, AdaBoost, gradient boosting trees, and XGBoost were evaluated comprehensively through a case study of ACC inhibitor data sets. Internal and external data sets were employed for cross-validation of the eight machine learning methods. Results showed that the extremely randomized trees model performed best and was adopted as the first step of virtual screening. Together with structure-based virtual screening in the second step, this combined strategy obtained desirable results. This work indicates that the combination of machine learning methods with traditional structure-based virtual screening can effectively strengthen the ability in finding potential hits from large compound database for a given target.

## 24. Chalcogenide Phase Change Material for Active Terahertz Photonics.
**Keywords:** **'germanium antimony telluride', 'metamaterials', 'non-volatile photonics', 'photonics', 'terahertz', 'ultrafast modulators'**

*Journal: Advanced materials (Deerfield Beach, Fla.)* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-27*

*abstract:* The strikingly contrasting optical properties of various phases of chalcogenide phase change materials (PCM) has recently led to the development of novel photonic devices such as all-optical non-von Neumann memory, nanopixel displays, color rendering, and reconfigurable nanoplasmonics. However, the exploration of chalcogenide photonics is currently limited to optical and infrared frequencies. Here, a phase change material integrated terahertz metamaterial for multilevel nonvolatile resonance switching with spatial and temporal selectivity is demonstrated. By controlling the crystalline proportion of the PCM film, multilevel, non-volatile, terahertz resonance switching states with long retention time at zero hold power are realized. Spatially selective reconfiguration at sub-metamaterial scale is shown by delivering electrical stimulus locally through designer interconnect architecture. The PCM metamaterial also features ultrafast optical modulation of terahertz resonances with tunable switching speed based on the crystalline order of the PCM film. The multilevel nonvolatile, spatially selective, and temporally tunable PCM metamaterial will provide a pathway toward development of novel and disruptive terahertz technologies including spatio-temporal terahertz modulators for high speed wireless communication, neuromorphic photonics, and machine-learning metamaterials.

## 25. In silico prediction of chemical reproductive toxicity using machine learning.
**Keywords:** **'machine learning', 'molecular fingerprint', 'reproductive toxicity', 'structural alerts', 'structure-activity relationship'**

*Journal: Journal of applied toxicology : JAT* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-27*

*abstract:* Reproductive toxicity is an important regulatory endpoint in health hazard assessment. Because the in vivo tests are expensive, time consuming and require a large number of animals, which must be killed, in silico approaches as the alternative strategies have been developed to assess the potential reproductive toxicity (reproductive toxicity) of chemicals. Some prediction models for reproductive toxicity have been developed, but most of them were built only based on one single endpoint such as embryo teratogenicity; therefore, these models may not provide reliable predictions for toxic chemicals with other endpoints, such as sperm reduction or gonadal dysgenesis. Here, a total of 1823 chemicals for reproductive toxicity characterized by multiple endpoints were used to develop structure-activity relationship models by six machine-learning approaches with nine molecular fingerprints. Among the models, MACCSFP-SVM model has the best performance for the external validation set (area under the curve = 0.900, classification accuracy = 0.836). The applicability domain was analyzed, and a rational boundary was found to distinguish inaccurate predictions and accurate predictions. Moreover, several structural alerts for characterizing reproductive toxicity were identified using the information gain combining substructure frequency analysis. Our results would be helpful for the prediction of the reproductive toxicity of chemicals.

## 26. Natural language generation for electronic health records.


*Journal: NPJ digital medicine* *Publication Date: 2018-Nov-19*



*abstract:* One broad goal of biomedical informatics is to generate fully-synthetic, faithfully representative electronic health records (EHRs) to facilitate data sharing between healthcare providers and researchers and promote methodological research. A variety of methods existing for generating synthetic EHRs, but they are not capable of generating unstructured text, like emergency department (ED) chief complaints, history of present illness, or progress notes. Here, we use the encoder-decoder model, a deep learning algorithm that features in many contemporary machine translation systems, to generate synthetic chief complaints from discrete variables in EHRs, like age group, gender, and discharge diagnosis. After being trained end-to-end on authentic records, the model can generate realistic chief complaint text that appears to preserve the epidemiological information encoded in the original record-sentence pairs. As a side effect of the model's optimization goal, these synthetic chief complaints are also free of relatively uncommon abbreviation and misspellings, and they include none of the personally identifiable information (PII) that was in the training data, suggesting that this model may be used to support the de-identification of text in EHRs. When combined with algorithms like generative adversarial networks (GANs), our model could be used to generate fully-synthetic EHRs, allowing healthcare providers to share faithful representations of multimodal medical data without compromising patient privacy. This is an important advance that we hope will facilitate the development of machine-learning methods for clinical decision support, disease surveillance, and other data-hungry applications in biomedical informatics.

## 27. Geoffrey: An Automated Schedule System on a Social Robot for the Intellectually Challenged.


*Journal: Computational intelligence and neuroscience* *Publication Date: 2018*

[https://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/4350272](https://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2018/4350272){: .btn}

*abstract:* The accelerated growth of the percentage of elder people and persons with brain injury-related conditions and who are intellectually challenged are some of the main concerns of the developed countries. These persons often require special cares and even almost permanent overseers that help them to carry out diary tasks. With this issue in mind, we propose an automated schedule system which is deployed on a social robot. The robot keeps track of the tasks that the patient has to fulfill in a diary basis. When a task is triggered, the robot guides the patient through its completion. The system is also able to detect if the steps are being properly carried out or not, issuing alerts in that case. To do so, an ensemble of deep learning techniques is used. The schedule is customizable by the carers and authorized relatives. Our system could enhance the quality of life of the patients and improve their self-autonomy. The experimentation, which was supervised by the ADACEA foundation, validates the achievement of these goals.

## 29. Bio-inspired Analysis of Deep Learning on Not-So-Big Data Using Data-Prototypes.
**Keywords:** **'data prototypes', 'deep learning', 'interpretability', 'not so big data', 'transfer learning'**

*Journal: Frontiers in computational neuroscience* *Publication Date: 2018*

*abstract:* Deep artificial neural networks are feed-forward architectures capable of very impressive performances in diverse domains. Indeed stacking multiple layers allows a hierarchical composition of local functions, providing efficient compact mappings. Compared to the brain, however, such architectures are closer to a single pipeline and require huge amounts of data, while concrete cases for either human or machine learning systems are often restricted to not-so-big data sets. Furthermore, interpretability of the obtained results is a key issue: since deep learning applications are increasingly present in society, it is important that the underlying processes be accessible and understandable to every one. In order to target these challenges, in this contribution we analyze how considering prototypes in a rather generalized sense (with respect to the state of the art) allows to reasonably work with small data sets while providing an interpretable view of the obtained results. Some mathematical interpretation of this proposal is discussed. Sensitivity to hyperparameters is a key issue for reproducible deep learning results, and is carefully considered in our methodology. Performances and limitations of the proposed setup are explored in details, under different hyperparameter sets, in an analogous way as biological experiments are conducted. We obtain a rather simple architecture, easy to explain, and which allows, combined with a standard method, to target both performances and interpretability.

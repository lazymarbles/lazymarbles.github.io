Sixteen artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) approaches were
reported at the 2018 annual congresses of the American Society for Reproductive
Biology (9) and European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology (7).
Nearly every aspect of patient care was investigated, including sperm morphology,
sperm identification, identification of empty or oocyte containing follicles,
predicting embryo cell stages, predicting blastocyst formation from oocytes,
assessing human blastocyst quality, predicting live birth from blastocysts,
improving embryo selection, and for developing optimal IVF stimulation protocols.
This represents a substantial increase in reports over 2017, where just one
abstract each was reported at ASRM (AI) and ESHRE (ML). Our analysis reveals wide
variability in how AI and ML methods are described (from not at all or very
generic to fully describing the architectural framework) and large variability on
accepted dataset sizes (from just 3 patients with 16 follicles in the smallest
dataset to 661,060 images of 11,898 human embryos in one of the largest). AI and 
ML are clearly burgeoning methodologies in human reproduction and embryology and 
would benefit from early application of reporting standards.

Digital images of rock samples have been using extensively in Digital Rock
Physics (DRP) to evaluate physical parameters of rock such as permeability, P-
and S-wave velocities and formation factor. The parameters are numerically
computed by simulation of the corresponding physical processes through segmented 
image of rock, which provide a direct and accurate evaluation of rock properties.
However, recent advances in machine learning and Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNN) allow using images as input. Such networks, however, require a considerable
number of images as input. In this paper, CNNs are used to estimate the P- and
S-wave velocities from images of rock medium. To deal with lack of input data, a 
hybrid pattern- and pixel-based simulation (HYPPS) is used as an efficient data
augmentation method to increase the training data set. For each input image, 10
stochastic realizations are produced. Compare to the case wherein the stochastic 
models are not used, the new results from the enhanced network indicate a sharp
improvement in the estimations such that R2 is increased to 0.94. Furthermore,
the newly developed CNN network, unlike the one with the small data set
(R2=0.75), manifests no over/underestimation. The estimated properties, in
comparison with the computational results, indicate that CNNs perform
outstandingly in predicting the physical parameters of rock without conducting
any time-demanding forward modeling if enough input data are provided.

Biopharmaceutical industry R&D, and indeed other life sciences R&D such as
biomedical, environmental, agricultural and food production, is becoming
increasingly data-driven and can significantly improve its efficiency and
effectiveness by implementing the FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable,
reusable) guiding principles for scientific data management and stewardship. By
so doing, the plethora of new and powerful analytical tools such as artificial
intelligence and machine learning will be able, automatically and at scale, to
access the data from which they learn, and on which they thrive. FAIR is a
fundamental enabler for digital transformation.

Continued improvement in MRI acquisition technology has made functional MRI
(fMRI) with small isotropic voxel sizes down to 1 mm and below more commonly
available. Although many conventional fMRI studies seek to investigate regional
patterns of cortical activation for which conventional voxel sizes of 3 mm and
larger provide sufficient spatial resolution, smaller voxels can help avoid
contamination from adjacent white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and 
thereby increase the specificity of fMRI to signal changes within the gray
matter. Unfortunately, temporal signal-to-noise ratio (tSNR), a metric of fMRI
sensitivity, is reduced in high-resolution acquisitions, which offsets the
benefits of small voxels. Here we introduce a framework that combines small,
isotropic fMRI voxels acquired at 7 T field strength with a novel
anatomically-informed, surface mesh-navigated spatial smoothing that can provide 
both higher detection power and higher resolution than conventional voxel sizes. 
Our smoothing approach uses a family of intracortical surface meshes and allows
for kernels of various shapes and sizes, including curved 3D kernels that adapt
to and track the cortical folding pattern. Our goal is to restrict smoothing to
the cortical gray matter ribbon and avoid noise contamination from CSF and signal
dilution from WM via partial volume effects. We found that the intracortical
kernel that maximizes tSNR does not maximize percent signal change (ΔS/S), and
therefore the kernel configuration that optimizes detection power cannot be
determined from tSNR considerations alone. However, several kernel configurations
provided a favorable balance between boosting tSNR and ΔS/S, and allowed a 1.1-mm
isotropic fMRI acquisition to have higher performance after smoothing (in terms
of both detection power and spatial resolution) compared to an unsmoothed 3.0-mm 
isotropic fMRI acquisition. Overall, the results of this study support the
strategy of acquiring voxels smaller than the cortical thickness, even for
studies not requiring high spatial resolution, and smoothing them down within the
cortical ribbon with a kernel of an appropriate shape to achieve the best
performance-thus decoupling the choice of fMRI voxel size from the spatial
resolution requirements of the particular study. The improvement of this new
intracortical smoothing approach over conventional surface-based smoothing is
expected to be modest for conventional resolutions, however the improvement is
expected to increase with higher resolutions. This framework can also be applied 
to anatomically-informed intracortical smoothing of higher-resolution data (e.g. 
along columns and layers) in studies with prior information about the spatial
structure of activation.

Background: The fast-moving progress of the third generation long read sequencing
technologies will soon bring the biological and medical sciences to a new era of 
research. Altogether the technique and experimental procedures are becoming more 
straightforward and available to biologists from diverse fields, even without any
profound experience in DNA sequencing. Thus, the introduction of the MinIONTM
device by Oxford Nanopore Technologies promises to "bring sequencing technology
to the masses" and also allows quick and operative analysis in field studies.
However, the convenience of this sequencing technology dramatically contrasts
with the available analysis tools, which may significantly reduce enthusiasm of a
"regular" user. To really bring the sequencing technology to every biologist, we 
need a set of user-friendly tools that can perform a powerful analysis in an
automatic manner.
Findings: NanoPipe was developed in consideration of the specifics of the
MinIONTM sequencing technologies, providing accordingly adjusted alignment
parameters. The range of the target species/sequences for the alignment is not
limited, and the descriptive usage page of NanoPipe helps a user to succeed with 
NanoPipe analysis. The results contain alignment statistics, consensus sequence, 
polymorphisms data, and visualization of the alignment. Several test cases are
used to demonstrate efficiency of the tool.
Conclusions: Freely available NanoPipe software allows effortless and reliable
analysis of MinIONTM sequencing data for experienced bioinformaticians, as well
for wet-lab biologists with minimum bioinformatics knowledge. Moreover, for the
latter group, we describe the basic algorithm of actions necessary for MinIONTM
sequencing analysis from the first to last step.

Recent Advances in Flexible and Wearable Pressure Sensors Based on Piezoresistive
3D Monolithic Conductive Sponges.

Ding Y, Xu T, Onyilagha O, Fong H, Zhu Z.

High-performance flexible strain and pressure sensors are important components of
the systems for human motion detection, human-machine interaction, soft robotics,
electronic skin, etc., which are envisioned as the key technologies for
applications in future human healthcare monitoring and artificial intelligence.
In recent years, highly flexible and wearable strain/pressure sensors have been
developed based on various materials/structures and transduction mechanisms.
Piezoresistive three-dimensional (3D) monolithic conductive sponge, the
resistance of which changes upon external pressure or stimuli, has emerged as a
forefront material for flexible and wearable pressure sensor due to its excellent
sensor performance, facile fabrication, and simple circuit integration. This
review focuses on the rapid development of the piezoresistive pressure sensors
based on 3D conductive sponges. Various piezoresistive conductive sponges are
categorized into four different types and their material and structural
characteristics are summarized. Methods for preparation of the 3D conductive
sponges are reviewed, followed by examples of device performance and selected
applications. The review concludes with a critical reflection of the current
status and challenges. Prospects of the 3D conductive sponge for flexible and
wearable pressure sensor are discussed.

Artificial intelligence (AI), beyond the concrete applications that have already 
become part of our daily lives, makes it possible to process numerous and
heterogeneous data and knowledge, and to understand potentially complex and
abstract rules in a manner human intelligence can but without human intervention.
AI combines two properties, self-learning by the successive and repetitive
processing of data as well as the capacity to adapt, that is to say the
possibility for a scripted program to deal with multiple situations likely to
vary over time. Roundtable experts confirmed the potential contribution and
theoretical benefit of AI in clinical research and in improving the efficiency of
patient care. Experts also measured, as is the case for any new process that
people need to get accustomed to, its impact on practices and mindset. To
maximize the benefits of AI, four critical points have been identified. The
careful consideration of these four points conditions the technical integration
and the appropriation by all actors of the life science spectrum: researchers,
regulators, drug developers, care establishments, medical practitioners and,
above all, patients and the civil society. 1st critical point: produce tangible
demonstrations of the contributions of AI in clinical research by quantifying its
benefits. 2nd critical point: build trust to foster dissemination and
acceptability of AI in healthcare thanks to an adapted regulatory framework. 3rd 
critical point: ensure the availability of technical skills, which implies an
investment in training, the attractiveness of the health sector relative to
tech-heavy sectors and the development of ergonomic data collection tools for all
health operators. 4th critical point: organize a system of governance for a
distributed and secure model at the national level to aggregate the information
and services existing at the local level. Thirty-seven concrete recommendations
have been formulated which should pave the way for a widespread adoption of AI in
clinical research. In this context, the French "Health data hub" initiative
constitutes an ideal opportunity.

**Keywords:**** **

*Journal: Zhonghua wei chang wai ke za zhi = Chinese journal of gastrointestinal surgery* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-25*



*abstract:* Colorectal cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors, and its incidence and mortality are increasing year by year in China. In 2018, for the first time, the FIT-DNA test was written into the expert consensus as the recommended screening technology in China. As the core technology of colorectal cancer screening, colonoscopy for right colon cancer is further supported. With the application of artificial intelligence technology in colonoscopy, the efficiency and accuracy of screening will be greatly improved. New screening technologies represented by circulating tumor cell (CTC) and individualized screening programs based on molecular genetics are future directions. As the core of colorectal cancer treatment, surgery has become quite mature. Traditional laparoscopic surgery has become an optimal choice for colorectal cancer surgery. Open surgery, robotic surgery and single-incision laparoscopic surgery have not been found superior to multiport laparoscopic surgery. The focus of surgical research is to precisely select surgical methods, and to protect normal physiological function of patients. For example, in order to reduce complications and improve quality of life in patients undergoing rectal cancer surgery after neoadjuvant radiotherapy, the "Tianhe surgery" was invented by the authors' team. Chemotherapy as the basis of colorectal cancer treatment has shown good results in many aspects: The PRODIGE-7 trial has confirmed that systemic chemotherapy is more important for colorectal peritoneal metastasis after high quality cytoreductive surgery (CRS). While the addition of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) with oxaliplatin does not result in the better overall survival (OS), but increases the risk of postoperative complications. The FOWARC study has found that the FOLFOX regimen (oxaliplatin and fluorouracil) achieved a 3-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate similar to that of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, challenging the clinical value of radiotherapy. Although several studies have confirmed that total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) can improve pathological complete response (pCR) rate and DFS of patients with colorectal cancer, we do not recommend unretricted expansion of chemotherapy. How to combine the clinical characteristics and molecular biological markers to select high-risk groups for chemotherapy, and how to use personalized medicine according to the genetic characteristics of patients, are also hot spots of current research. Immunotherapy is a game-changer in all aspects of colorectal cancer. In order to adapt to the immune therapy, the efficacy evaluation standard of solid tumors (iRECIST) has been revised. Immune score could redefine tumor clinical staging system. Both the Checkmate-142 study for advanced tumors and the NCT03026140 study on neoadjuvant treatment for early tumors showed promising results. Although no significant progress has been seen in the EGFR-targeted therapy and VEGFR-targeted therapy, new targeted drugs such as Eltanexor (ETLA, kpt -8602) and cobimetinib (MEK inhibitor) have been found to be effective in clinical studies. According to the detection results of tumor-related signaling pathways in patients, cross-guidance selection of targeted drug therapy is also the direction of research. Although the IWWD research results give a big blow to the "watch and wait" strategy, with the exploration of TNT plan, more accurate imaging efficacy evaluation and the application of immunotherapy, the "watch and wait" strategy will also receive new attention. In recent years, we have seen the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology. Although it is still in the exploratory stage in the field of medicine, it will certainly reshape all aspects of colorectal cancer diagnosis and treatment in the future, leading the research direction.

*abstract:* Sedation of neurocritically ill patients is one of the most challenging situation in ICUs. Quantitative knowledge on the sedation effect on brain activity in that complex scenario could help to uncover new markers for sedation assessment. Hence, we aim to evaluate the existence of changes of diverse EEG-derived measures in deeply-sedated (RASS -Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale- -4 and -5) neurocritically ill patients, and also whether sedation doses are related with those eventual changes. &#13; Approach: We performed an observational prospective cohort study in the Intensive Care Unit of the Hospital de la Princesa. Twenty-six adult patients suffered from Traumatic Brain Injury and Subarachnoid Hemorrhage were included in the present study. Long-term continuous electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings (2141h) and hourly annotated information were used to determine the relationship between intravenous sedation infusion doses and network and spectral EEG measures. To do that, two different strategies were followed: assessment of the statistical dependence between both variables using the Spearman correlation rank and by performing an automatic classification method based on a machine learning algorithm.&#13; Main results: More than 60% of patients presented a correlation greater than 0.5 in at least one of the calculated EEG measures with the sedation dose. The automatic classification method presented an accuracy of 84.3% in discriminating between different sedation doses. In both cases the nodes' degree was the most relevant measurement.&#13; Significance: The results presented here provide evidences of brain activity changes during deep sedation linked to sedation doses. Particularly, the capability of network EEG-derived measures in discriminating between different sedation doses could be the framework for the development of accurate methods for sedation levels assessment.

*abstract:* The treatment planning process for patients with head and neck (H&N) cancer is regarded as one of the most complicated due to large target volume, multiple prescription dose levels, and many radiation-sensitive critical structures near the target. Treatment planning for this site requires a high level of human expertise and a tremendous amount of effort to produce personalized high quality plans, taking as long as a week, which deteriorates the chances of tumor control and patient survival. To solve this problem, we propose to investigate a deep learning-based dose prediction model, Hierarchically Densely Connected U-net, based on two highly popular network architectures: U-net and DenseNet. We find that this new architecture is able to accurately and efficiently predict the dose distribution, outperforming the other two models, the Standard U-net and DenseNet, in homogeneity, dose conformity, and dose coverage on the test data. Averaging across all organs at risk, our proposed model is capable of predicting the organ-at-risk max dose within 6.3% and mean dose within 5.1% of the prescription dose on the test data. The other models, the Standard U-net and DenseNet, performed worse, having an averaged organ-at-risk max dose prediction error of 8.2% and 9.3%, respectively, and averaged mean dose prediction error of 6.4% and 6.8%, respectively. In addition, our proposed model used 12 times less trainable parameters than the Standard U-net, and predicted the patient dose 4 times faster than DenseNet.

**Keywords:**** 'Big data', 'Emergency medical services', 'Enhanced Two Step Floating Catchment Area', 'Spatio-temporal analysis'**

*Journal: Health & place* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-28*

[https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1353-8292(18)30331-9](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1353-8292(18)30331-9){: .btn}

*abstract:* Medical accessibility is an important indicator for evaluating the effectiveness of public health services. However, the previous medical accessibility studies mainly focus on spatial accessibility without considering temporal variation in population distribution which is significant for evaluating access to emergency medical service (EMS). This paper proposes a model of spatio-temporal accessibility to EMS called ST-E2SFCA based on adapting the enhanced two-step floating catchment area (E2SFCA) method. We apply our method to the greater Tokyo area for a large volume of GPS dataset with millions of users and compare the accessibility difference over space and time. To evaluate our model, we also analyze the distinction of our model over different weight sets and compare the performance of ST-E2SFCA with the traditional E2SFCA. The result shows that our method can illustrate the temporal difference and is suitable for measuring the spatio-temporal accessibility to EMS, thus can guide the hospital location selection and urban planning.

## 5. Recurrent inference machines for reconstructing heterogeneous MRI data.
**Keywords:**** 'Deep learning', 'Inverse problems', 'MRI', 'Reconstruction'**

*Journal: Medical image analysis* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-18*

[https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1361-8415(18)30607-8](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1361-8415(18)30607-8){: .btn}

*abstract:* Deep learning allows for accelerated magnetic resonance image (MRI) reconstruction, thereby shortening measurement times. Rather than using sparsifying transforms, a prerequisite in Compressed Sensing (CS), suitable MRI prior distributions are learned from data. In clinical practice, both the underlying anatomy as well as image acquisition settings vary. For this reason, deep neural networks must be able to reapply what they learn across different measurement conditions. We propose to use Recurrent Inference Machines (RIM) as a framework for accelerated MRI reconstruction. RIMs solve inverse problems in an iterative and recurrent inference procedure by repeatedly reassessing the state of their reconstruction, and subsequently making incremental adjustments to it in accordance with the forward model of accelerated MRI. RIMs learn the inferential process of reconstructing a given signal, which, in combination with the use of internal states as part of their recurrent architecture, makes them less dependent on learning the features pertaining to the source of the signal itself. This gives RIMs a low tendency to overfit, and a high capacity to generalize to unseen types of data. We demonstrate this ability with respect to anatomy by reconstructing brain and knee scans, as well as other MRI acquisition settings, by reconstructing scans of different contrast and resolution, at different field strength, subjected to varying acceleration levels. We show that RIMs outperform CS not only with respect to quality metrics, but also according to a rating given by an experienced neuroradiologist in a double blinded experiment. Finally, we show with qualitative results that our model can be applied to prospectively under-sampled raw data, as acquired by pre-installed acquisition protocols.

*abstract:* To make available to the medical imaging community a computed tomography (CT) image database composed of hybrid datasets (patient CT images with digitally inserted anthropomorphic lesions) where lesion ground truth is known a priori. It is envisioned that such a dataset could be a resource for the assessment of CT image quality, machine learning, and imaging technologies (e.g., computer aided detection (CAD) and segmentation algorithms).

## 7. Correlating exhaled aerosol images to small airway obstructive diseases: A study with dynamic mode decomposition and machine learning.

[http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0211413](http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0211413){: .btn}

*abstract:* Exhaled aerosols from lungs have unique patterns, and their variation can be correlated to the underlying lung structure and associated abnormities. However, it is challenging to characterize such aerosol patterns and differentiate their difference because of their complexity. This challenge is even greater for small airway diseases, where the disturbance signals are weak.

## 8. An Accelerated Linearly Convergent Stochastic L-BFGS Algorithm.
**Keywords:**** **

*Journal: IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-25*

[https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2019.2891088](https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TNNLS.2019.2891088){: .btn}

*abstract:* The limited memory version of the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (L-BFGS) algorithm is the most popular quasi-Newton algorithm in machine learning and optimization. Recently, it was shown that the stochastic L-BFGS (sL-BFGS) algorithm with the variance-reduced stochastic gradient converges linearly. In this paper, we propose a new sL-BFGS algorithm by importing a proper momentum. We prove an accelerated linear convergence rate under mild conditions. The experimental results on different data sets also verify this acceleration advantage.

## 9. Object Detection With Deep Learning: A Review.
**Keywords:**** **

*Journal: IEEE transactions on neural networks and learning systems* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-28*

*abstract:* Due to object detection's close relationship with video analysis and image understanding, it has attracted much research attention in recent years. Traditional object detection methods are built on handcrafted features and shallow trainable architectures. Their performance easily stagnates by constructing complex ensembles that combine multiple low-level image features with high-level context from object detectors and scene classifiers. With the rapid development in deep learning, more powerful tools, which are able to learn semantic, high-level, deeper features, are introduced to address the problems existing in traditional architectures. These models behave differently in network architecture, training strategy, and optimization function. In this paper, we provide a review of deep learning-based object detection frameworks. Our review begins with a brief introduction on the history of deep learning and its representative tool, namely, the convolutional neural network. Then, we focus on typical generic object detection architectures along with some modifications and useful tricks to improve detection performance further. As distinct specific detection tasks exhibit different characteristics, we also briefly survey several specific tasks, including salient object detection, face detection, and pedestrian detection. Experimental analyses are also provided to compare various methods and draw some meaningful conclusions. Finally, several promising directions and tasks are provided to serve as guidelines for future work in both object detection and relevant neural network-based learning systems.

## 10. Walking Imagery Evaluation in Brain Computer Interfaces via a New Deep Learning Framework.
**Keywords:**** **

*Journal: IEEE transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-25*

[https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2019.2895064](https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2019.2895064){: .btn}

*abstract:* Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based on motor imagery (MI) have been widely used to support the rehabilitation of motor functions of upper limbs rather than lower limbs. This is probably because it is more difficult to detect brain activities of lower limb MI. In order to reliably detect the brain activities of lower limbs to restore or improve the walking ability of the disabled, we propose a new paradigm of walking imagery (WI) in a virtual environment (VE) in order to elicit reliable brain activities and achieve a significant training effect. First, we extract and fuse both spatial and time-frequency features as a multi-view feature (MVF) to represent the patterns in the brain activity. Second, we design a multi-view multi-level deep polynomial network (MMDPN) to explore the complementarity among the features so as to improve the detection of walking from an idle state. Our extensive experimental results show that the VE-based paradigm significantly performs better than the traditional text-based paradigm. In addition, the VE-based paradigm can effectively help users to modulate brain activities and improve the quality of electroencephalography signals. We also observe that the MMDPN outperforms other deep learning methods in terms of classification performance.

## 11. Mining within-trial oscillatory brain dynamics to address the variability of optimized spatial filters.
**Keywords:**** **

*Journal: IEEE transactions on neural systems and rehabilitation engineering : a publication of the IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology Society* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-25*

[https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2019.2894914](https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TNSRE.2019.2894914){: .btn}

*abstract:* Data-driven spatial filtering algorithms optimize scores such as the contrast between two conditions to extract oscillatory brain signal components. Most machine learning approaches for filter estimation, however, disregard within-trial temporal dynamics and are extremely sensitive to changes in training data and involved hyperparameters. This leads to highly variable solutions and impedes the selection of a suitable candidate for, e.g., neurotechnological applications. Fostering component introspection, we propose to embrace this variability by condensing the functional signatures of a large set of oscillatory components into homogeneous clusters, each representing specific within-trial envelope dynamics. The proposed method is exemplified by and evaluated on a complex hand force task with a rich within-trial structure. Based on electroencephalography data of 18 healthy subjects, we found that the components' distinct temporal envelope dynamics are highly subject-specific. On average, we obtained seven clusters per subject, which were strictly confined regarding their underlying frequency bands. As the analysis method is not limited to a specific spatial filtering algorithm, it could be utilized for a wide range of neurotechnological applications, e.g., to select and monitor functionally relevant features for brain-computer interface protocols in stroke rehabilitation.

## 12. Prior Information Guided Regularized Deep Learning for Cell Nucleus Detection.
**Keywords:**** **

*Journal: IEEE transactions on medical imaging* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-25*

[https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2019.2895318](https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TMI.2019.2895318){: .btn}

*abstract:* Cell nuclei detection is a challenging research topic because of limitations in cellular image quality and diversity of nuclear morphology, i.e. varying nuclei shapes, sizes, and overlaps between multiple cell nuclei. This has been a topic of enduring interest with promising recent success shown by deep learning methods. These methods train Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with a training set of input images and known, labeled nuclei locations. Many such methods are supplemented by spatial or morphological processing. Using a set of canonical cell nuclei shapes, prepared with the help of a domain expert, we develop a new approach that we call Shape Priors with Convolutional Neural Networks (SP-CNN). We further extend the network to introduce a shape prior (SP) layer and then allowing it to become trainable (i.e. optimizable). We call this network tunable SP-CNN (TSP-CNN). In summary, we present new network structures that can incorporate 'expected behavior' of nucleus shapes via two components: learnable layers that perform the nucleus detection and a fixed processing part that guides the learning with prior information. Analytically, we formulate two new regularization terms that are targeted at: 1) learning the shapes, 2) reducing false positives while simultaneously encouraging detection inside the cell nucleus boundary. Experimental results on two challenging datasets reveal that the proposed SP-CNN and TSP-CNN can outperform state-of-the-art alternatives.

## 13. Joint Rain Detection and Removal from a Single Image with Contextualized Deep Networks.
**Keywords:**** **

*Journal: IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-28*

[https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2019.2895793](https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TPAMI.2019.2895793){: .btn}

*abstract:* Rain streaks, particularly in heavy rain, not only degrade visibility but also make many computer vision algorithms fail to function properly. In this paper, we address this visibility problem by focusing on single-image rain removal, even in the presence of dense rain streaks and rain-streak accumulation, which is visually similar to mist or fog. To achieve this, we introduce a new rain model and a deep learning architecture. Our rain model incorporates a binary rain map indicating rain-streak regions, and accommodates various shapes, directions, and sizes of overlapping rain streaks, as well as rain accumulation, to model heavy rain. Based on this model, we construct a multi-task deep network, which jointly learns three targets: the binary rain-streak map, rain streak layers, and clean background, which is our ultimate output. To generate features that can be invariant to rain steaks, we introduce a contextual dilated network, which is able to exploit regional contextual information. To handle various shapes and directions of overlapping rain streaks, our strategy is to utilize a recurrent process that progressively removes rain streaks. Our binary map provides a constraint and thus additional information to train our network. Extensive evaluation on real images, particularly in heavy rain, shows the effectiveness of our model and architecture.

## 14. Deep Neural Generative Model of Functional MRI Images for Psychiatric Disorder Diagnosis.
**Keywords:**** **

*Journal: IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-28*

[https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2019.2895663](https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2019.2895663){: .btn}

*abstract:* Accurate diagnosis of psychiatric disorders plays a critical role in improving the quality of life for patients and potentially supports the development of new treatments. Many studies have been conducted on machine learning techniques that seek brain imaging data for specific biomarkers of disorders. These studies have encountered the following dilemma: An end-to-end classification overfits to a small number of high-dimensional samples but unsupervised feature-extraction has the risk of extracting a signal of no interest. In addition, such studies often provided only diagnoses for patients without presenting the reasons for these diagnoses. This study proposed a deep neural generative model of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. The proposed model is conditioned by the assumption of the subject's state and estimates the posterior probability of the subject's state given the imaging data, using Bayes' rule. This study applied the proposed model to diagnose schizophrenia and bipolar disorders. Diagnostic accuracy was improved by a large margin over competitive approaches, namely classifications of functional connectivity and discriminative/generative models of region-wise signals with or without unsupervised feature-extractors. The proposed model visualizes brain regions largely related to the disorders, thus motivating further biological investigation.

## 15. Comprehensive and empirical evaluation of machine learning algorithms for small molecule LC retention time prediction.

*abstract:* Liquid chromatography is a core component of almost all mass spectrometric analyses of (bio)molecules. Because of the high-throughput nature of mass spectrometric analyses, the interpretation of these chromatographic data increasingly relies on informatics solutions that attempt to predict an analyte's retention time. The key components of such predictive algorithms are the features these are supplies with, and the actual machine learning algorithm used to fit the model parameters. Therefore, we have evaluated the performance of seven machine learning algorithms on 36 distinct metabolomics data sets, using two distinct feature sets. Interestingly, the results show that no single learning algorithm performs optimally for all data sets, with different types of algorithms achieving top performance for different types of analytes or different protocols. Our results thus show that an evaluation of machine learning algorithms for retention time prediction is needed to find a suitable algorithm for specific analytes or protocols. Importantly, however, our results also show that blending different types of models together decreases the error on outliers, indicating that the combination of several approaches holds substantial promise for the development of more generic, high-performing algorithms.

*abstract:* The Paris System for Urine Cytopathology (the Paris System) has succeeded in making the analysis of liquid-based urine preparations more reproducible. Any algorithm seeking to automate this system must accurately estimate the nuclear-to-cytoplasmic (N:C) ratio and produce a qualitative "atypia score." The authors propose a hybrid deep-learning and morphometric model that reliably automates the Paris System.

*abstract:* The in vitro MultiFlow® DNA Damage Assay multiplexes γH2AX, p53, phospho-histone H3, and polyploidization biomarkers into a single flow cytometric analysis [Bryce et al., 2016]. The current report describes a tiered, sequential data analysis strategy based on data generated from exposure of human TK6 cells to a previously described 85 chemical training set and a new pharmaceutical-centric test set (n=40). In each case, exposure was continuous over a range of closely spaced concentrations, and cell aliquots were removed for analysis following 4 and 24 hr of treatment. The first data analysis step focused on chemicals' genotoxic potential, and for this purpose we evaluated the performance of a machine learning (ML) ensemble, a rubric that considered fold increases in biomarkers against global evaluation factors (GEFs), and a hybrid strategy that considered ML and GEFs. This first tier further used ML output and/or GEFs to classify genotoxic activity as clastogenic and/or aneugenic. Test set results demonstrated the generalizability of the first tier, with particularly good performance from the ML ensemble: 35/40 (88%) concordance with a priori genotoxicity expectations and 21/24 (88%) agreement with expected mode of action (MoA). A second tier applied unsupervised hierarchical clustering to the biomarker response data, and these analyses were found to group certain chemicals, especially aneugens, according to their molecular targets. Finally, a third tier utilized benchmark dose analyses and MultiFlow biomarker responses to rank genotoxic potency. The relevance of these rankings is supported by the strong agreement found between benchmark dose values derived from MultiFlow biomarkers compared to those generated from parallel in vitro micronucleus analyses. Collectively, the results suggest that a tiered MultiFlow data analysis pipeline is capable of rapidly and effectively identifying genotoxic hazards while providing additional information that is useful for modern risk assessments-MoA, molecular targets, and potency.

*abstract:* Reliable automated segmentation of the prostate is indispensable for image-guided prostate interventions. However, the segmentation task is challenging due to inhomogeneous intensity distributions, variation in prostate anatomy, among other problems. Manual segmentation can be time-consuming and is subject to inter- and intra-observer variation. We developed an automated deep learning-based method to address this technical challenge.

*abstract:* Smartphones enable the implementation of just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) that tailor the delivery of health interventions over time to user- and time-varying context characteristics. Ideally, JITAIs include effective intervention components, and delivery tailoring is based on effective moderators of intervention effects. Using machine learning techniques to infer each user's context from smartphone sensor data is a promising approach to further enhance tailoring.

*abstract:* Neuroanatomy has been deemed crucial for clinical neurosciences. It has been one of the most challenging parts of the anatomical curriculum and is one of the causes of "neurophobia", whose main implication is a negative influence on the choice of neurology in the near future. In the last decades, several educational strategies have been identified to improve the skills of students and to promote a deep learning. The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature to identify the most effective method/s to teach human neuroanatomy. The search was restricted to publications written in English language and to articles describing teaching tools in undergraduate medical courses from January 2006 through December 2017. The primary outcome was the observation of improvement of anatomical knowledge in undergraduate medical students. Secondary outcomes were the amelioration of long-term retention knowledge and the grade of satisfaction of students. Among 18 selected studies, 44.4% have used three-dimensional (3D) teaching tools, 16.6% near peer teaching tool, 5.55% flipped classroom tool, 5.55% applied neuroanatomy elective course, 5.55% equivalence-based instruction-rote learning, 5.55% mobile augmented reality, 5.55% inquiry-based clinical case, 5.55% cadaver dissection, and 5.55% Twitter. The high in-between study heterogeneity was the main issue to identify the most helpful teaching tool to improve neuroanatomical knowledge among medical students. Data from this study suggest that a combination of multiple pedagogical resources seems to be the more advantageous for teaching neuroanatomy. This article is protected by copyright.

*abstract:* In the past three years, Machine Learning (ML) in combination with Density Functional Theory (DFT) has enabled computational screening of compounds with the goal of accelerated materials discovery. Unfortunately, DFT+ML has, until now, either relied on knowledge of the atomic positions at DFT energy minima, which are a priori unknown, or has been limited to chemical spaces of modest size. Here we report a strategy that we term Learning-in-Templates (LiT) wherein we first define a series of space group and stoichiometry templates corresponding to hypothesized compounds and, orthogonally, we allow any list of atoms to take on any template. The LiT approach is deployed in combination with previously-established position-dependent representations and performs best with the representations that rely least on the atomic positions. Since the positions of the atoms in templates are known and do not change, LiT enables us to infer the properties of interest directly; additionally, LiT allows working with increased chemical spaces, since the same elements can take on a large number of templates. Only by using LiT were we able to span a 5x106 double perovskite compounds and achieve an acceleration factor of 700 compared to brute-force DFT, allowing us to predict never-before-screened compounds. Our findings motivated us to synthesize a new BaCuyTa

*abstract:* In the last decades, laparoscopic surgery has become the gold standard in patients with colorectal cancer. To overcome the drawback of reduced tactile feedback, real-time tissue classification could be of great benefit. In this ex vivo study, hyperspectral imaging (HSI) was used to distinguish tumor tissue from healthy surrounding tissue. A sample of fat, healthy colorectal wall, and tumor tissue was collected per patient and imaged using two hyperspectral cameras, covering the wavelength range from 400 to 1700 nm. The data were randomly divided into a training (75%) and test (25%) set. After feature reduction, a quadratic classifier and support vector machine were used to distinguish the three tissue types. Tissue samples of 32 patients were imaged using both hyperspectral cameras. The accuracy to distinguish the three tissue types using both hyperspectral cameras was 0.88 (STD  =  0.13) on the test dataset. When the accuracy was determined per patient, a mean accuracy of 0.93 (STD  =  0.12) was obtained on the test dataset. This study shows the potential of using HSI in colorectal cancer surgery for fast tissue classification, which could improve clinical outcome. Future research should be focused on imaging entire colon/rectum specimen and the translation of the technique to an intraoperative setting.

*abstract:* Water-fat separation is a postprocessing technique most commonly applied to multiple-gradient-echo magnetic resonance (MR) images to identify fat, provide images with fat suppression, and to measure fat tissue concentration. Recently, Numerous advancements have been reported. In contrast to early methods, the process of water-fat separation has become complicated due to multiparametric analytic models, optimization methods, and the absence of a unified framework for diverse source data.

*Journal: Statistics in medicine* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-30*



*abstract:* Deep learning neural network models such as multilayer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN) are novel and attractive artificial intelligence computing tools. However, evaluation of the performance of these methods is not readily available for practitioners yet. We provide a tutorial for evaluating classification accuracy for various state-of-the-art learning approaches, including familiar shallow and deep learning methods. For qualitative response variables with more than two categories, many traditional accuracy measures such as sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve are not applicable and we have to consider their extensions properly. In this paper, a few important statistical concepts for multicategory classification accuracy are reviewed and their utilities for various learning algorithms are demonstrated with real medical examples. We offer problem-based R code to illustrate how to perform these statistical computations step by step. We expect that such analysis tools will become more familiar to practitioners and receive broader applications in biostatistics.

*abstract:* microRNAs (miRNAs) are short, noncoding regulatory RNAs derived from hairpin precursors (pre-miRNAs). In synergy with experimental approaches, computational approaches have become an invaluable tool for identifying miRNAs at the genome scale. We have recently reported a method called miRLocator, which applies machine learning algorithms to accurately predict the localization of most likely miRNAs within their pre-miRNAs. One major strength of miRLocator is the fact that the machine learning-based miRNA prediction model can be automatically trained using a set of miRNAs of particular interest, with informative features extracted from miRNA-miRNA* duplexes and the optimized ratio between positive and negative samples. Here, we present a detailed protocol for miRLocator that performs the training and prediction processes using a python implementation and web interface. The source codes, web interface, and manual documents are freely available to academic users at https://github.com/cma2015/miRLocator .

*Journal: Science and engineering ethics* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-30*

*abstract:* This paper examines the ethical pitfalls and challenges that non-ethicists, such as researchers and programmers in the fields of computer science, artificial intelligence and robotics, face when building moral machines. Whether ethics is "computable" depends on how programmers understand ethics in the first place and on the adequacy of their understanding of the ethical problems and methodological challenges in these fields. Researchers and programmers face at least two types of problems due to their general lack of ethical knowledge or expertise. The first type is so-called rookie mistakes, which could be addressed by providing these people with the necessary ethical knowledge. The second, more difficult methodological issue concerns areas of peer disagreement in ethics, where no easy solutions are currently available. This paper examines several existing approaches to highlight the ethical pitfalls and challenges involved. Familiarity with these and similar problems can help programmers to avoid pitfalls and build better moral machines. The paper concludes that ethical decisions regarding moral robots should be based on avoiding what is immoral (i.e. prohibiting certain immoral actions) in combination with a pluralistic ethical method of solving moral problems, rather than relying on a particular ethical approach, so as to avoid a normative bias.

*abstract:* Decision making has long been of interest as a descriptive phenomenon in psychology and as a generative one in artificial intelligence. Research ranges from general, descriptive models of heuristic decision making to detailed studies of decision parameters. This paper introduces a model that formalizes and integrates several descriptive models so that it can serve both as a framework for psychological models and as an algorithm for computational decision making. We set special focus on the instantiation of this model with respect to aggregating cue values by reviewing some methods from the field of computational social choice. To show its applicability in the context of artificial intelligence we present a case study of computational problem solving.

*abstract:* There is currently great interest in applying neural networks to prediction tasks in medicine. It is important for predictive models to be able to use survival data, where each patient has a known follow-up time and event/censoring indicator. This avoids information loss when training the model and enables generation of predicted survival curves. In this paper, we describe a discrete-time survival model that is designed to be used with neural networks, which we refer to as Nnet-survival. The model is trained with the maximum likelihood method using mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The use of SGD enables rapid convergence and application to large datasets that do not fit in memory. The model is flexible, so that the baseline hazard rate and the effect of the input data on hazard probability can vary with follow-up time. It has been implemented in the Keras deep learning framework, and source code for the model and several examples is available online. We demonstrate the performance of the model on both simulated and real data and compare it to existing models Cox-nnet and Deepsurv.

## 32. The Feasibility and Acceptability of a Smartphone-Based Music Intervention for Acute Pain.
**Keywords:**** **

*Journal: Proceedings of the ... Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences. Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-08*



*abstract:* Pain is an unpleasant experience the neurobiology of which is influenced by psychosocial factors including negative affect. Music is a ubiquitous experience that can improve affect, potentially decreasing anxiety and catastrophizing, both of which are associated with greater pain severity. We hypothesized that a machine-learning generative music intervention in the form of a smartphone web app (Unwind) could be used to modulate the experience of pain. In this pilot study, we recruited 15 individuals with acute pain who were admitted to an observation unit in the emergency department, and were being treated with opioids. Participants used the music intervention (Unwind) during this brief hospitalization, after which we assessed their response to its use through a semi-structured qualitative interview. Overall, participants responded positively to Unwind. While some reported some technical challenges, participants were willing to continue using it at home. In particular, participants reported using Unwind to address their anxiety, and many used it to facilitate sleep in the presence of pain. This study demonstrates that individuals with acute pain will accept and use a smartphone-based music protocol.

*abstract:* The sensorimotor cortex is somatotopically organized to represent the vocal tract articulators, such as lips, tongue, larynx, and jaw. How speech and articulatory features are encoded at the subcortical level, however, remains largely unknown. We analyzed local field potential (LFP) recordings from the subthalamic nucleus (STN) and simultaneous electrocorticography recordings from the sensorimotor cortex of 11 human subjects (1 female) with Parkinson's disease during implantation of deep brain stimulation (DBS) electrodes, while they read aloud three-phoneme words. The initial phonemes involved either articulation primarily with the tongue (coronal consonants) or the lips (labial consonants). We observed significant increases in high gamma (60-150 Hz) power in both the STN and the sensorimotor cortex that began before speech onset and persisted for the duration of speech articulation. As expected from previous reports, in the sensorimotor cortex, the primary articulators involved in the production of the initial consonants were topographically represented by high gamma activity. We found that STN high gamma activity also demonstrated specificity for the primary articulator, although no clear topography was observed. In general, subthalamic high gamma activity varied along the ventral-dorsal trajectory of the electrodes, with greater high gamma power recorded in the dorsal locations of the STN. Interestingly, the majority of significant articulator-discriminative activity in the STN occurred prior to that in sensorimotor cortex. These results demonstrate that articulator-specific speech information is contained within high gamma activity of the STN, but with different spatial and temporal organization compared to similar information encoded in the sensorimotor cortex.

*abstract:* The goal of temporal indexing is to select an occurred time or time interval for each medical entity in clinical notes, so that all medical entities can be indexed on a united timeline, which could assist the understanding of clinical notes and the further application of medical entities. Some temporal relation shared tasks for the medical entity in English clinical notes have been organized in the past few years, such as the 2012 i2b2 NLP challenge, 2015 and 2016 clinical TempEval challenges. In these tasks, many heuristics rule-based and machine learning-based systems have been developed. In recent years, the deep neural network models have shown great potential on many problems including the relation classification.

*abstract:* Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has recently brought new insight into cell differentiation processes and functional variation in cell subtypes from homogeneous cell populations. A lack of prior knowledge makes unsupervised machine learning methods, such as clustering, suitable for analyzing scRNA-seq . However, there are several limitations to overcome, including high dimensionality, clustering result instability, and parameter adjustment complexity. In this study, we propose a method by combining structure entropy and k nearest neighbor to identify cell subpopulations in scRNA-seq data. In contrast to existing clustering methods for identifying cell subtypes, minimized structure entropy results in natural communities without specifying the number of clusters. To investigate the performance of our model, we applied it to eight scRNA-seq datasets and compared our method with three existing methods (nonnegative matrix factorization, single-cell interpretation via multikernel learning, and structural entropy minimization principle). The experimental results showed that our approach achieves, on average, better performance in these datasets compared to the benchmark methods.

*abstract:* The study aims to explore the spatial distribution of multi-tendinous muscle modulated by central nervous system (CNS) during sustained contraction. Nine subjects were recruited to trace constant target forces with right index finger extension. Surface electromyography (sEMG) of extensor digitorum (ED) were recorded with a 32-channel electrode array. Nine successive topographic maps (TM) were obtained. Pixel wise analysis was utilized to extract subtracted topographic maps (STM), which exhibited inhomogeneous distribution. STMs were characterized into hot, warm, and cool regions corresponding to higher, moderate, and lower change ranges, respectively. The relative normalized area (normalized to the first phase) of these regions demonstrated different changing trends as rising, plateauing, and falling over time, respectively. Moreover, the duration of these trends were found to be affected by force level. The rising/falling periods were longer at lower force levels, while the plateau can be achieved from the initial phase for higher force output (45% maximal voluntary contraction). The results suggested muscle activity reorganization in ED plays a role to maintain sustained contraction. Furthermore, the decreased dynamical regulation ability to spatial reorganization may be prone to induce fatigue. This finding implied that spatial reorganization of muscle activity as a regulation mechanism contribute to maintain constant force production.

*abstract:* Conservation researchers require low-cost access to acoustic monitoring technology. However, affordable tools are often constrained to short-term studies due to high energy consumption and limited storage. To enable long-term monitoring, energy and space efficiency must be improved on such tools. This paper describes the development and deployment of three acoustic detection algorithms that reduce the power and storage requirements of acoustic monitoring on affordable, open-source hardware. The algorithms aim to detect bat echolocation, to search for evidence of an endangered cicada species, and also to collect evidence of poaching in a protected nature reserve. The algorithms are designed to run on AudioMoth: a low-cost, open-source acoustic monitoring device, developed by the authors and widely adopted by the conservation community. Each algorithm addresses a detection task of increasing complexity, implementing extra analytical steps to account for environmental conditions such as wind, analysing samples multiple times to prevent missed events, and incorporating a hidden Markov model for sample classification in both the time and frequency domain. For each algorithm, we report on real-world deployments carried out with partner organisations and also benchmark the hidden Markov model against a convolutional neural network, a deep-learning technique commonly used for acoustics. The deployments demonstrate how acoustic detection algorithms extend the use of low-cost, open-source hardware and facilitate a new avenue for conservation researchers to perform large-scale monitoring.

*abstract:* Successful applications of brain-computer interface (BCI) approaches to motor imagery (MI) are still limited. In this paper, we propose a classification framework for MI electroencephalogram (EEG) signals that combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture with a variational autoencoder (VAE) for classification. The decoder of the VAE generates a Gaussian distribution, so it can be used to fit the Gaussian distribution of EEG signals. A new representation of input was developed by combining the time, frequency, and channel information from the EEG signal, and the CNN-VAE method was designed and optimized accordingly for this form of input. In this network, the classification of the extracted CNN features is performed via the deep network VAE. Our framework, with an average kappa value of 0.564, outperforms the best classification method in the literature for BCI Competition IV dataset 2b with a 3% improvement. Furthermore, using our own dataset, the CNN-VAE framework also yields the best performance for both three-electrode and five-electrode EEGs and achieves the best average kappa values 0.568 and 0.603, respectively. Our results show that the proposed CNN-VAE method raises performance to the current state of the art.

*abstract:* The recent success of small-molecule kinase inhibitors as anticancer drugs has generated significant interest in their application to other clinical areas, such as disorders of the central nervous system (CNS). However, most kinase inhibitor drug candidates investigated to date have been ineffective at treating CNS disorders, mainly due to poor blood⁻brain barrier (BBB) permeability. It is, therefore, imperative to evaluate new chemical entities for both kinase inhibition and BBB permeability. Over the last 35 years, marine biodiscovery has yielded 471 natural products reported as kinase inhibitors, yet very few have been evaluated for BBB permeability. In this study, we revisited these marine natural products and predicted their ability to cross the BBB by applying freely available open-source chemoinformatics and machine learning algorithms to a training set of 332 previously reported CNS-penetrant small molecules. We evaluated several regression and classification models, and found that our optimised classifiers (random forest, gradient boosting, and logistic regression) outperformed other models, with overall cross-validated model accuracies of 80%⁻82% and 78%⁻80% on external testing. All 3 binary classifiers predicted 13 marine-derived kinase inhibitors with appropriate physicochemical characteristics for BBB permeability.

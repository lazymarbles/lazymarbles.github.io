*abstract:* Machine learning (ML) is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) giving computer systems the ability to learn data, without being explicitly programmed. ML is currently successfully used for optical character recognition, spam filtering, and face recognition. The aim of this study is to review its current application in the field of neuro-oncology.

## 2. A Web-Based Platform for People With Memory Problems and Their Caregivers (CAREGIVERSPRO-MMD): Mixed-Methods Evaluation of Usability.
**Keywords:** **'caregivers', 'dementia', 'social support', 'technology'**

*Journal: JMIR formative research* *Publication Date: 2018-Mar-12*



*abstract:* The increasing number of people with dementia (PwD) drives research exploring Web-based support interventions to provide effective care for larger populations. In this concept, a Web-based platform (CAREGIVERSPRO-MMD, 620911) was designed to (1) improve the quality of life for PwD, (2) reduce caregiver burden, (3) reduce the financial costs for care, and (4) reduce administration time for health and social care professionals.

*abstract:* Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, autoimmune disease which may result in a higher risk of cardiovascular (CV) events and stroke. Tissue characterization and risk stratification of patients with rheumatoid arthritis are a challenging problem. Risk stratification of RA patients using traditional risk factor-based calculators either underestimates or overestimates the CV risk. Advancements in medical imaging have facilitated early and accurate CV risk stratification compared to conventional cardiovascular risk calculators.

*abstract:* We propose a new deep learning based approach to provide more accurate whole-body PET/MRI attenuation correction in comparison to the Dixon-based four-segment method. We use activity and attenuation maps estimated using the maximum likelihood reconstruction of activity and attenuation (MLAA) algorithm as inputs to convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn a CT-derived attenuation map. 

## 7. REM sleep's unique associations with corticosterone regulation, apoptotic pathways, and behavior in chronic stress in mice.
**Keywords:** **'EEG theta power', 'anhedonia', 'depression', 'machine learning', 'transcriptome'**

*Journal: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-25*

*abstract:* One of sleep's putative functions is mediation of adaptation to waking experiences. Chronic stress is a common waking experience; however, which specific aspect of sleep is most responsive, and how sleep changes relate to behavioral disturbances and molecular correlates remain unknown. We quantified sleep, physical, endocrine, and behavioral variables, as well as the brain and blood transcriptome in mice exposed to 9 weeks of unpredictable chronic mild stress (UCMS). Comparing 46 phenotypic variables revealed that rapid-eye-movement sleep (REMS), corticosterone regulation, and coat state were most responsive to UCMS. REMS theta oscillations were enhanced, whereas delta oscillations in non-REMS were unaffected. Transcripts affected by UCMS in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and blood were associated with inflammatory and immune responses. A machine-learning approach controlling for unspecific UCMS effects identified transcriptomic predictor sets for REMS parameters that were enriched in 193 pathways, including some involved in stem cells, immune response, and apoptosis and survival. Only three pathways were enriched in predictor sets for non-REMS. Transcriptomic predictor sets for variation in REMS continuity and theta activity shared many pathways with corticosterone regulation, in particular pathways implicated in apoptosis and survival, including mitochondrial apoptotic machinery. Predictor sets for REMS and anhedonia shared pathways involved in oxidative stress, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. These data identify REMS as a core and early element of the response to chronic stress, and identify apoptosis and survival pathways as a putative mechanism by which REMS may mediate the response to stressful waking experiences.

*abstract:* Deep learning provides an automatic and robust solution to depression severity evaluation. However, despite it is powerful, there is a trade-off between robust performance and the cost of manual annotation.

**Journal:** *Physiological measurement*

*abstract:* &lt;b&gt;Objective:&lt;/b&gt; Evaluate a method for the estimation of the nocturnal systolic blood pressure (SBP) dip from 24-hour blood pressure (BP) trends using a wrist-worn photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor and a deep neural network in free-living individuals, comparing the deep neural network to traditional machine learning and non-machine learning baselines. &#13; &#13; &lt;b&gt;Approach:&lt;/b&gt; A wrist-worn PPG sensor was worn by 106 healthy individuals for 226 days during which 5111 reference values for BP were obtained with a 24-hour ambulatory BP monitor and matched with the PPG sensor data. Features based on heart rate variability and pulse morphology were extracted from the PPG waveforms. Long- and short term memory (LSTM) networks, dense networks, random forests and linear regression models were trained and evaluated in their capability of tracking trends in BP, as well as the estimation of the SBP dip. &#13; &#13; &lt;b&gt;Main results:&lt;/b&gt; Best performance for estimating the SBP dip were obtained with a deep LSTM neural network with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 3.12±2.20 mmHg and a correlation of 0.69 (p=3·10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;). This dip was derived from trend estimates of BP which had an RMSE of 8.22±1.49 mmHg for systolic and 6.55±1.39 mmHg for diastolic BP (DBP). While other models had similar performance for the tracking of relative BP, they did not perform as well as the LSTM for the SBP dip. &#13; &#13; &lt;b&gt;Significance:&lt;/b&gt; The work provides first evidence for the unobtrusive estimation of the nocturnal SBP dip, a highly prognostic clinical parameter. It is also the first to evaluate unobtrusive BP measurement in a large data set of unconstrained 24- hour measurements in free-living individuals and provides evidence for the utility of LSTM models in this domain.

#### [2. Predicting forced vital capacity (FVC) using support vector regression (SVR).](https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6579/ab031c){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Wang Chenshuo, Chen Xianxiang, Zhao Rongjian, He Zhengling, Zhao Zhan, Zhan Qingyuan, Yang Ting, Fang Zhen*

**Journal:** *Physiological measurement*

*abstract:* &#13; Objectives: Spirometry, as the golden approach in the diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), has strict end-of-test (EOT) criteria (e.g., complete exhalation), which cannot be met by patients with compromised health situations. Thus, significant parameters measured by spirometry such as FVC has limited accuracies. In order to address this issue, the present study was aimed to develop models based on support vector regression to predict values of FVC under the condition that the EOT criteria were not fully met.&#13; Approach: The prediction models for the quantification of FVC were developed based on SVR. 354 subjects conducted conventional spirometry (CS) and the resulting data of forced expiratory volumes in one second (FEV1), peak expiratory flow(PEF), age and gender were used as input features and the resulting values of the FVC were used as the target feature in the prediction models. After that, three prediction models (Mixed Model, Normal Model and Abnormal Model) were established according to the criterion in the diagnosis of COPD that a postbronchodilator FEV1/FVC lower than 0.70. Then 35 subjects were recruited to be tested with both CS and low-degree-of EOT criteria spirometry (LDCS), which did not fully met the EOT criteria of CS. In LDCS, subjects were allowed to terminate the procedures based on their own wills at any time after the technicians assumed that both acceptable values of FEV1 and PEF were obtained. Quantified values of FVC derived from both CS and LDCS were compared to validate the performances of the developed prediction models.&#13; Main results: The FVC prediction performance of the Normal Model and Abnormal Model were better than that of the Mixed Model. The RMSE are lower than 0.35L and the accuracy are higher to 95%. One tailed t test results demonstrate that the absolute differences of the measured and predicted values are not significantly different from 0.15L for both Abnormal Model and Normal Model.&#13; Significance: Our study shows the possibility of predicting FVC with acceptable precision in cases of the EOT criteria of spirometry were not fully met, which can be beneficial for patients who cannot or did not make full exhalation in spirometry.&#13.

**Journal:** *AJR. American journal of roentgenology*

*abstract:* Radiology reports are rich resources for biomedical researchers. Before utilization of radiology reports, experts must manually review these reports to identify the categories. In fact, automatically categorizing electronic medical record (EMR) text with key annotation is difficult because it has a free-text format. To address these problems, we developed an automated system for disease annotation.

**Authors:** *Li Yanjuan, Niu Mengting, Zou Quan*

**Journal:** *Journal of proteome research*

*abstract:* The major histocompatibility complex (MHC) is a term for all gene groups of major histocompatibility antigen. It binds to peptide chains derived from pathogens and displays pathogens on the cell surface to facilitate T-cell recognition and perform a series of immune function. MHC molecules are critical in transplantation, autoimmunity, infection and tumor immunotherapy. Combining machine learning algorithms and making full use of bioinformatics analysis technology, more accurate recognition of MHC is an important task. The paper proposed a new MHC recognition method compared with traditional biological methods. And used the built classifier to classify and identify MHC I and MHC II. The classifier used the SVMProt 188D, bag-of-ngrams (BonG) and information theory (IT) mixed feature representation methods, and used the extreme learning machine (ELM), which selects lin-kernel as the activation function and used ten-fold cross-validation and the independent test set validation verify the accuracy of the constructed classifier, and simultaneously identify the MHC, and identify the MHC I and MHC II respectively. Through the ten-fold cross-validation, the proposed algorithm obtained 91.66% accuracy when identifying MHC, and 94.442% accuracy when identifying MHC categories. Furthermore, an online identification website named ELM-MHC was constructed with the following URL: http://server.malab.cn/ELM-MHC/.

**Authors:** *Tyryshkina Anastasia, Coraor Nate, Nekrutenko Anton*

**Journal:** *Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)*

*abstract:* One of the many technical challenges that arises when scheduling bioinformatics analyses at scale is determining the appropriate amount of memory and processing resources. Both over- and under-allocation leads to an inefficient use of computational infrastructure. Over allocation locks resources that could otherwise be used for other analyses. Under allocation causes job failure and requires analyses to be repeated with a larger memory or runtime allowance. We address this challenge by using a historical dataset of bioinformatics analyses run on the Galaxy platform to demonstrate the feasibility of an online service for resource requirement estimation.

**Authors:** *Anzalone Andrew V, Zairis Sakellarios, Lin Annie J, Rabadan Raul, Cornish Virginia W*

**Journal:** *Biochemistry*

*abstract:* RNA signals located downstream of stop codons in eukaryotic mRNAs can stimulate high levels of translational readthrough (RT) by the ribosome, thereby giving rise to functionally distinct c-terminally extended protein products. Although many RT events have been previously discovered in Nature, a broader description of the stimulatory RNA signals would help to identify new reprogramming events in eukaryotic genes and provide insights into the molecular mechanisms of readthrough. Here, we explore the RNA reprogramming landscape by performing in vitro translation selections to enrich RNA readthrough signals de novo from a starting randomized library comprising >10

**Authors:** *Zhong Jing, Chen Jian-Ming, Chen Song-Lin, Yi Yun-Feng*

**Journal:** *Combinatorial chemistry & high throughput screening*

*abstract:* A significant proportion of patients with early non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) can be cured by surgery. The distant metastasis of tumors is the most common cause of treatment failure. Precisely predicting the likelihood that a patient develops distant metastatic risk will help identify patients who can further intervene, such as conventional adjuvant chemotherapy or experimental drugs.

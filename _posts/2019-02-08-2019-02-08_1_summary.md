No LinkOut links available for UID: 30728857

**Authors:** *Ellis Randall J, Wang Zichen, Genes Nicholas, Ma'ayan Avi*

**Journal:** *BioData mining*

*abstract:* The opioid epidemic in the United States is averaging over 100 deaths per day due to overdose. The effectiveness of opioids as pain treatments, and the drug-seeking behavior of opioid addicts, leads physicians in the United States to issue over 200 million opioid prescriptions every year. To better understand the biomedical profile of opioid-dependent patients, we analyzed information from electronic health records (EHR) including lab tests, vital signs, medical procedures, prescriptions, and other data from millions of patients to predict opioid substance dependence.

**Journal:** *Frontiers in genetics*

*abstract:* Within aquaculture industries, selection based on genomic information (genomic selection) has the profound potential to change genetic improvement programs and production systems. Genomic selection exploits the use of realized genomic relationships among individuals and information from genome-wide markers in close linkage disequilibrium with genes of biological and economic importance. We discuss the technical advances, practical requirements, and commercial applications that have made genomic selection feasible in a range of aquaculture industries, with a particular focus on molluscs (pearl oysters,

#### 24. Quantitative Electroencephalography in Guiding Treatment of Major Depression.

**Authors:** *Schiller Mark J*

**Journal:** *Frontiers in psychiatry*

*abstract:* This paper reviews significant contributions to the evidence for the use of quantitative electroencephalography features as biomarkers of depression treatment and examines the potential of such technology to guide pharmacotherapy. Frequency band abnormalities such as alpha and theta band abnormalities have shown promise as have combinatorial measures such as cordance (a measure combining alpha and theta power) and the Antidepressant Treatment Response Index in predicting medication treatment response. Nevertheless, studies have been hampered by methodological problems and inconsistencies, and these approaches have ultimately failed to elicit any significant interest in actual clinical practice. More recent machine learning approaches such as the Psychiatric Encephalography Evaluation Registry (PEER) technology and other efforts analyze large datasets to develop variables that may best predict response rather than test a priori hypotheses. PEER is a technology that may go beyond predicting response to a particular antidepressant and help to guide pharmacotherapy.

#### 25. CERENKOV2: improved detection of functional noncoding SNPs using data-space geometric features.

**Authors:** *Yao Yao, Liu Zheng, Wei Qi, Ramsey Stephen A*

**Journal:** *BMC bioinformatics*

*abstract:* We previously reported on CERENKOV, an approach for identifying regulatory single nucleotide polymorphisms (rSNPs) that is based on 246 annotation features. CERENKOV uses the xgboost classifier and is designed to be used to find causal noncoding SNPs in loci identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). We reported that CERENKOV has state-of-the-art performance (by two traditional measures and a novel GWAS-oriented measure, AVGRANK) in a comparison to nine other tools for identifying functional noncoding SNPs, using a comprehensive reference SNP set (OSU17, 15,331 SNPs). Given that SNPs are grouped within loci in the reference SNP set and given the importance of the data-space manifold geometry for machine-learning model selection, we hypothesized that within-locus inter-SNP distances would have class-based distributional biases that could be exploited to improve rSNP recognition accuracy. We thus defined an intralocus SNP "radius" as the average data-space distance from a SNP to the other intralocus neighbors, and explored radius likelihoods for five distance measures.

#### 26. DeepPVP: phenotype-based prioritization of causative variants using deep learning.

**Authors:** *Boudellioua Imane, Kulmanov Maxat, Schofield Paul N, Gkoutos Georgios V, Hoehndorf Robert*

**Journal:** *BMC bioinformatics*

*abstract:* Prioritization of variants in personal genomic data is a major challenge. Recently, computational methods that rely on comparing phenotype similarity have shown to be useful to identify causative variants. In these methods, pathogenicity prediction is combined with a semantic similarity measure to prioritize not only variants that are likely to be dysfunctional but those that are likely involved in the pathogenesis of a patient's phenotype.

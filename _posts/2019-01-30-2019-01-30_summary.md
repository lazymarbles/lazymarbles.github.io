*abstract:* An Artificial Intelligence system was developed and implemented for water, wastewater, and reuse plants to improve management of sensors, short and long-term maintenance plans, asset and investment management plans. It is based on an integrated approach to capture data from different computer systems and files. It adds a layer of intelligence to the data. It serves as a repository of key current and future operations and maintenance conditions that a plant needs have knowledge of. With this information, it can simulate the configuration of processes and assets for those conditions to improve or optimize operations, maintenance and asset management, using the IViewOps (Intelligent View of Operations) model. Based on the optimization through model runs, it is able to create output files that can feed data to other systems and inform the staff regarding optimal solutions to the conditions experienced or anticipated in the future.

## 2. Warming seas increase cold-stunning events for Kemp's ridley sea turtles in the northwest Atlantic.


*Journal: PloS one* *Publication Date: 2019*

*abstract:* Since the 1970s, the magnitude of turtle cold-stun strandings have increased dramatically within the northwestern Atlantic. Here, we examine oceanic, atmospheric, and biological factors that may affect the increasing trend of cold-stunned Kemp's ridleys in Cape Cod Bay, Massachusetts, United States of America. Using machine learning and Bayesian inference modeling techniques, we demonstrate higher cold-stunning years occur when the Gulf of Maine has warmer sea surface temperatures in late October through early November. Surprisingly, hatchling numbers in Mexico, a proxy for population abundance, was not identified as an important factor. Further, using our Bayesian count model and forecasted sea surface temperature projections, we predict more than 2,300 Kemp's ridley turtles may cold-stun annually by 2031 as sea surface temperatures continue to increase within the Gulf of Maine. We suggest warmer sea surface temperatures may have modified the northerly distribution of Kemp's ridleys and act as an ecological bridge between the Gulf Stream and nearshore waters. While cold-stunning may currently account for a minor proportion of juvenile mortality, we recommend continuing efforts to rehabilitate cold-stunned individuals to maintain population resiliency for this critically endangered species in the face of a changing climate and continuing anthropogenic threats.

## 3. Label-free classification of cells based on supervised machine learning of subcellular structures.


*Journal: PloS one* *Publication Date: 2019*

[http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0211347](http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0211347){: .btn}

*abstract:* It is demonstrated that cells can be classified by pattern recognition of the subcellular structure of non-stained live cells, and the pattern recognition was performed by machine learning. Human white blood cells and five types of cancer cell lines were imaged by quantitative phase microscopy, which provides morphological information without staining quantitatively in terms of optical thickness of cells. Subcellular features were then extracted from the obtained images as training data sets for the machine learning. The built classifier successfully classified WBCs from cell lines (area under ROC curve = 0.996). This label-free, non-cytotoxic cell classification based on the subcellular structure of QPM images has the potential to serve as an automated diagnosis of single cells.

## 4. Using supervised learning to select audit targets in performance-based financing in health: An example from Zambia.


*Journal: PloS one* *Publication Date: 2019*

[http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0211262](http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0211262){: .btn}

*abstract:* Independent verification is a critical component of performance-based financing (PBF) in health care, in which facilities are offered incentives to increase the volume of specific services but the same incentives may lead them to over-report. We examine alternative strategies for targeted sampling of health clinics for independent verification. Specifically, we empirically compare several methods of random sampling and predictive modeling on data from a Zambian PBF pilot that contains reported and verified performance for quantity indicators of 140 clinics. Our results indicate that machine learning methods, particularly Random Forest, outperform other approaches and can increase the cost-effectiveness of verification activities.

Clear, valid insight to the anticipated resolution time could assist in planning treatment intervention.

## 6. Deceleration, Acceleration, and Impacts Are Strong Contributors to Muscle Damage in Professional Australian Football.


*Journal: Journal of strength and conditioning research* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-23*

[http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000003023](http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000003023){: .btn}

*abstract:* Gastin, PB, Hunkin, SL, Fahrner, B, and Robertson, S. Deceleration, acceleration, and impacts are strong contributors to muscle damage in professional Australian football. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationships between serum creatine kinase [CK], an indirect marker of muscle damage, and specific indices of match load in elite Australian football. Twenty-six professional players were assessed during a competitive Australian Football League (AFL) season. [CK] was collected 24-36 hours before match and 34-40 hours after match during 8 in-season rounds. An athlete-tracking technology was used to quantify match load. Generalized estimating equations and random forest models were constructed to determine the extent to which match-load indices and pre-match [CK] explained post-match [CK]. There was a 129 ± 152% increase in [CK] in response to AFL competition. Generalized estimating equations found that number of impacts >3g (p = 0.004) and game time (p = 0.016) were most strongly associated with post-match [CK]. Random forest, with considerably lower errors (130 vs. 316 U·L), found deceleration, acceleration, impacts >3g, and sprint distance to be the strongest predictors. Pre-match [CK] accounted for 11% of post-match [CK], and considerable interindividual and intraindividual variability existed in the data. Creatine kinase, an indicator of muscle damage, was considerably elevated as a result of AFL competition. Parametric and machine-learning analysis techniques found several indices of physical load associated with muscle damage during competition, with impacts >3g and high-intensity running variables as the strongest predictors. [CK] may be used as a global measure of muscle damage in field team sports such as AF, yet with some caution given cost, invasiveness, and inherent variability. Quantifying physical load and the responses to that load can guide athlete management decision-making and is best undertaken within a suite of practical, sport-specific measures, where data are interpreted individually and with an understanding of the limitations.

## 7. Evaluation of Machine Learning Classifiers to Predict Compound Mechanism of Action When Transferred across Distinct Cell Lines.
**Keywords:** **'cancer and cancer drugs', 'cell-based assays', 'high-content screening', 'machine learning'**

*Journal: SLAS discovery : advancing life sciences R & D* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-29*

[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2472555218820805?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2472555218820805?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed){: .btn}

*abstract:* Multiparametric high-content imaging assays have become established to classify cell phenotypes from functional genomic and small-molecule library screening assays. Several groups have implemented machine learning classifiers to predict the mechanism of action of phenotypic hit compounds by comparing the similarity of their high-content phenotypic profiles with a reference library of well-annotated compounds. However, the majority of such examples are restricted to a single cell type often selected because of its suitability for simple image analysis and intuitive segmentation of morphological features. The aim of the current study was to evaluate and compare the performance of a classic ensemble-based tree classifier trained on extracted morphological features and a deep learning classifier using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained directly on images from the same dataset to predict compound mechanism of action across a morphologically and genetically distinct cell panel. Our results demonstrate that application of a CNN classifier delivers equivalent accuracy compared with an ensemble-based tree classifier at compound mechanism of action prediction within cell lines. However, our CNN analysis performs worse than an ensemble-based tree classifier when trained on multiple cell lines at predicting compound mechanism of action on an unseen cell line.

## 8. Mechanistic Reactivity Descriptors for the Prediction of Ames Mutagenicity of Primary Aromatic Amines.


*Journal: Journal of chemical information and modeling* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-29*

[https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00758](https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00758){: .btn}

*abstract:* Pharmaceutical products are often synthesized by the use of reactive starting materials and intermediates. These can, either as impurities or through metabolic activation, bind to the DNA. Primary aromatic amines belong to the critical classes that are considered potentially mutagenic in the Ames test so there is a great need of good prediction models for risk assessment. How primary aromatic amines exert their mutagenic potential can be rationalized by the widely accepted nitrenium ion hypothesis of covalent binding to the DNA of reactive electrophiles formed out of the aromatic amines. Since the reactive chemical species is different in chemical structure from the actual compound it is difficult to achieve good predictions via classical descriptor or fingerprint-based machine learning. In this approach, we use a combination of different molecular and atomic descriptors that is able to describe different mechanistic aspects of the metabolic transformation leading from the primary aromatic amine to the reactive metabolite that binds to the DNA. Applied to a test set, the combination shows significantly better performances than models that only use one of these descriptors and complemented the general internal Ames mutagenicity prediction model at Bayer.

## 9. An X-ray computed micro-tomography dataset for oil removal from carbonate porous media.


*Journal: Scientific data* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-29*

[http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2019.4](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2019.4){: .btn}

*abstract:* This study reveals the pore-scale details of oil mobilisation and recovery from a carbonate rock upon injection of aqueous nanoparticle (NP) suspensions. X-ray computed micro-tomography (μCT), which is a non-destructive imaging technique, was used to acquire a dataset which includes: (i) 3D images of the sample collected at the end of fluid injection steps, and (ii) 2D radiogram series collected during fluid injections. The latter allows monitoring fluid flow dynamics at time resolutions down to a few seconds using a laboratory-based μCT scanner. By making this dataset publicly available we enable (i) new image reconstruction algorithms to be tested on large images, (ii) further development of image segmentation algorithms based on machine learning, and (iii) new models for multi-phase fluid displacements in porous media to be evaluated using images of a dynamic process in a naturally occurring and complex material. This dataset is comprehensive in that it offers a series of images that were captured before/during/and after the immiscible fluid injections.

## 10. Using Passive Smartphone Sensing for Improved Risk Stratification of Patients With Depression and Diabetes: Cross-Sectional Observational Study.
**Keywords:** **'classification', 'comorbidity', 'depression', 'diabetes', 'mHealth', 'machine learning', 'mental health', 'passive sensing', 'risk assessment', 'smartphone'**

*Journal: JMIR mHealth and uHealth* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-29*

[http://mhealth.jmir.org/2019/1/e11041/](http://mhealth.jmir.org/2019/1/e11041/){: .btn}

*abstract:* Research studies are establishing the use of smartphone sensing to measure mental well-being. Smartphone sensor information captures behavioral patterns, and its analysis helps reveal well-being changes. Depression in diabetes goes highly underdiagnosed and underreported. The comorbidity has been associated with increased mortality and worse clinical outcomes, including poor glycemic control and self-management. Clinical-only intervention has been found to have a very modest effect on diabetes management among people with depression. Smartphone technologies could play a significant role in complementing comorbid care.

*abstract:* Autism spectrum disorder is a developmental disorder that describes certain challenges associated with communication (verbal and non-verbal), social skills, and repetitive behaviors. Typically, autism spectrum disorder is diagnosed in a clinical environment by licensed specialists using procedures which can be lengthy and cost-ineffective. Therefore, scholars in the medical, psychology, and applied behavioral science fields have in recent decades developed screening methods such as the Autism Spectrum Quotient and Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers for diagnosing autism and other pervasive developmental disorders. The accuracy and efficiency of these screening methods rely primarily on the experience and knowledge of the user, as well as the items designed in the screening method. One promising direction to improve the accuracy and efficiency of autism spectrum disorder detection is to build classification systems using intelligent technologies such as machine learning. Machine learning offers advanced techniques that construct automated classifiers that can be exploited by users and clinicians to significantly improve sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and efficiency in diagnostic discovery. This article proposes a new machine learning method called Rules-Machine Learning that not only detects autistic traits of cases and controls but also offers users knowledge bases (rules) that can be utilized by domain experts in understanding the reasons behind the classification. Empirical results on three data sets related to children, adolescents, and adults show that Rules-Machine Learning offers classifiers with higher predictive accuracy, sensitivity, harmonic mean, and specificity than those of other machine learning approaches such as Boosting, Bagging, decision trees, and rule induction.

*abstract:* The performance of left ventricular (LV) functional assessment using gated myocardial perfusion SPECT (MPS) relies on the accuracy of segmentation. Current methods require manual adjustments that are tedious and subjective. We propose a novel machine-learning-based method to automatically segment LV myocardium and measure its volume in gated MPS imaging without human intervention.

*abstract:* This Strategic Research Agenda identifies current challenges and needs in healthcare, illustrates how biomedical imaging and derived data can help to address these, and aims to stimulate dedicated research funding efforts.Medicine is currently moving towards a more tailored, patient-centric approach by providing personalised solutions for the individual patient. Innovation in biomedical imaging plays a key role in this process as it addresses the current needs for individualised prevention, treatment, therapy response monitoring, and image-guided surgery.The use of non-invasive biomarkers facilitates better therapy prediction and monitoring, leading to improved patient outcomes. Innovative diagnostic imaging technologies provide information about disease characteristics which, coupled with biological, genetic and -omics data, will contribute to an individualised diagnosis and therapy approach.In the emerging field of theranostics, imaging tools together with therapeutic agents enable the selection of best treatments and allow tailored therapeutic interventions.For prenatal monitoring, the use of innovative imaging technologies can ensure an early detection of malfunctions or disease.The application of biomedical imaging for diagnosis and management of lifestyle-induced diseases will help to avoid disease development through lifestyle changes.Artificial intelligence and machine learning in imaging will facilitate the improvement of image interpretation and lead to better disease prediction and therapy planning.As biomedical imaging technologies and analysis of existing imaging data provide solutions to current challenges and needs in healthcare, appropriate funding for dedicated research is needed to implement the innovative approaches for the wellbeing of citizens and patients.

## 16. Transferable Machine-Learning Model of the Electron Density.


*Journal: ACS central science* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-23*



*abstract:* The electronic charge density plays a central role in determining the behavior of matter at the atomic scale, but its computational evaluation requires demanding electronic-structure calculations. We introduce an atom-centered, symmetry-adapted framework to machine-learn the valence charge density based on a small number of reference calculations. The model is highly transferable, meaning it can be trained on electronic-structure data of small molecules and used to predict the charge density of larger compounds with low, linear-scaling cost. Applications are shown for various hydrocarbon molecules of increasing complexity and flexibility, and demonstrate the accuracy of the model when predicting the density on octane and octatetraene after training exclusively on butane and butadiene. This transferable, data-driven model can be used to interpret experiments, accelerate electronic structure calculations, and compute electrostatic interactions in molecules and condensed-phase systems.

*abstract:* Computational approaches to high-throughput data are gaining importance because of explosion of sequences in the post-genomic era. This explosion of sequence data creates a huge gap among the domains of sequence structure and function, since the experimental techniques to determine the structure and function are very expensive, time taking, and laborious in nature. Therefore, there is an urgent need to emphasize on the development of computational approaches in the field of biological systems. Engagement of proteins in quaternary arrangements, such as domain swapping, might be relevant for higher compatibility of such genes at stress conditions. In this study, the capacity to engage in domain swapping was predicted from mere sequence information in the whole genome of holy Basil (

*abstract:* Recent studies reveal that even the smallest genomes such as viruses evolve through complex and stochastic processes, and the assumption of independent alleles is not valid in most applications. Advances in sequencing technologies produce multiple time-point whole-genome data, which enable potential interactions between these alleles to be investigated empirically. To investigate these interactions, we represent alleles as distributed vectors that encode for relationships with other alleles in the course of evolution and apply artificial neural networks to time-sampled whole-genome datasets for feature learning. We build this platform using methods and algorithms derived from natural language processing (NLP), and we denote it as the nucleotide skip-gram neural network. We learn distributed vectors of alleles using the changes in allele frequency of echovirus 11 in the presence or absence of the disinfectant (ClO

## 21. Data-Driven Subtyping of Parkinson's Disease Using Longitudinal Clinical Records: A Cohort Study.


*Journal: Scientific reports* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-28*

[http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-37545-z](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-37545-z){: .btn}

*abstract:* Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with diverse clinical manifestations including motor and non-motor signs and symptoms, and emerging biomarkers. We aimed to reveal the heterogeneity of PD to define subtypes and their progression rates using an automated deep learning algorithm on the top of longitudinal clinical records. This study utilizes the data collected from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), which is a longitudinal cohort study of patients with newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease. Clinical information including motor and non-motor assessments, biospecimen examinations, and neuroimaging results were used for identification of PD subtypes. A deep learning algorithm, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), was used to represent each patient as a multi-dimensional time series for subtype identification. Both visualization and statistical analysis were performed for analyzing the obtained PD subtypes. As a result, 466 patients with idiopathic PD were investigated and three subtypes were identified. Subtype I (Mild Baseline, Moderate Motor Progression) is comprised of 43.1% of the participants, with average age 58.79 ± 9.53 years, and was characterized by moderate functional decay in motor ability but stable cognitive ability. Subtype II (Moderate Baseline, Mild Progression) is comprised of 22.9% of the participants, with average age 61.93 ± 6.56 years, and was characterized by mild functional decay in both motor and non-motor symptoms. Subtype III (Severe Baseline, Rapid Progression) is comprised 33.9% of the patients, with average age 65.32 ± 8.86 years, and was characterized by rapid progression of both motor and non-motor symptoms. These subtypes suggest that when comprehensive clinical and biomarker data are incorporated into a deep learning algorithm, the disease progression rates do not necessarily associate with baseline severities, and the progression rate of non-motor symptoms is not necessarily correlated with the progression rate of motor symptoms.

*abstract:* Efficient and effective solid waste management requires sufficient ability to predict the operational capacity of a system correctly. Waste prediction models have been widely studied and these models are always being challenged to perform more accurately. Unlike waste prediction models for mixed wastes, variables for yard waste are time sensitive and the effects of lag must be explicitly considered. This study is the first to specifically look at lag times relating to variables that attempt to predict municipal yard waste generation using machine learning approaches. Weekly averaged climatic and socio-economic variables are screened through correlation analysis and the significant variables are then used to develop yard waste models. These models then utilize artificial neural networks (ANN) where the variables are time lagged for a different number of weeks. This helps to realize a reduction in the error of the predicted weekly yard waste generation. Optimal lag times for each model varied from 1 to 11 weeks. The best model used both the ambient air temperature and population variables, in an ANN model with 3 layers, 11 neurons in the hidden layer, and an optimal lag time of 1 week. A mean absolute percentage error of 18.72% was obtained during the testing stage. One model saw a 55.4% decrease in the mean squared error at training, showing the value of lag time on the accuracy of weekly yard waste prediction models.

*abstract:* With the development of low-cost RGB-D (Red Green Blue-Depth) sensors, RGB-D object recognition has attracted more and more researchers' attention in recent years. The deep learning technique has become popular in the field of image analysis and has achieved competitive results. To make full use of the effective identification information in the RGB and depth images, we propose a multi-modal deep neural network and a DS (Dempster Shafer) evidence theory based RGB-D object recognition method. First, the RGB and depth images are preprocessed and two convolutional neural networks are trained, respectively. Next, we perform multi-modal feature learning using the proposed quadruplet samples based objective function to fine-tune the network parameters. Then, two probability classification results are obtained using two sigmoid SVMs (Support Vector Machines) with the learned RGB and depth features. Finally, the DS evidence theory based decision fusion method is used for integrating the two classification results. Compared with other RGB-D object recognition methods, our proposed method adopts two fusion strategies: Multi-modal feature learning and DS decision fusion. Both the discriminative information of each modality and the correlation information between the two modalities are exploited. Extensive experimental results have validated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

*abstract:* Robotic manipulators have to constantly deal with the complex task of detecting whether a grasp is stable or, in contrast, whether the grasped object is slipping. Recognising the type of slippage-translational, rotational-and its direction is more challenging than detecting only stability, but is simultaneously of greater use as regards correcting the aforementioned grasping issues. In this work, we propose a learning methodology for detecting the direction of a slip (seven categories) using spatio-temporal tactile features learnt from one tactile sensor. Tactile readings are, therefore, pre-processed and fed to a ConvLSTM that learns to detect these directions with just 50 ms of data. We have extensively evaluated the performance of the system and have achieved relatively high results at the detection of the direction of slip on unseen objects with familiar properties (82.56% accuracy).

*abstract:* We have compared the performance of different machine learning techniques for human activity recognition. Experiments were made using a benchmark dataset where each subject wore a device in the pocket and another on the wrist. The dataset comprises thirteen activities, including physical activities, common postures, working activities and leisure activities. We apply a methodology known as the activity recognition chain, a sequence of steps involving preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction and classification for traditional machine learning methods; we also tested convolutional deep learning networks that operate on raw data instead of using computed features. Results show that combination of two sensors does not necessarily result in an improved accuracy. We have determined that best results are obtained by the extremely randomized trees approach, operating on precomputed features and on data obtained from the wrist sensor. Deep learning architectures did not produce competitive results with the tested architecture.

*abstract:* Recently, we have been concerned with locating and tracking vehicles in aerial videos. Vehicles in aerial videos usually have small sizes due to use of cameras from a remote distance. However, most of the current methods use a fixed bounding box region as the input of tracking. For the purpose of target locating and tracking in our system, detecting the contour of the target is utilized and can help with improving the accuracy of target tracking, because a shape-adaptive template segmented by object contour contains the most useful information and the least background for object tracking. In this paper, we propose a new start-up of tracking by clicking on the target, and implement the whole tracking process by modifying and combining a contour detection network and a fully convolutional Siamese tracking network. The experimental results show that our algorithm has significantly improved tracking accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art regarding vehicle images in both OTB100 and DARPA datasets. We propose utilizing our method in real time tracking and guidance systems.

*abstract:* An automatic, fast, and accurate switching method between Global Positioning System and indoor positioning systems is crucial to achieve current user positioning, which is essential information for a variety of services installed on smart devices, e.g., location-based services (LBS), healthcare monitoring components, and seamless indoor/outdoor navigation and localization (SNAL). In this study, we proposed an approach to accurately detect the indoor/outdoor environment according to six different daily activities of users including walk, skip, jog, stay, climbing stairs up and down. We select a number of features for each activity and then apply ensemble learning methods such as Random Forest, and AdaBoost to classify the environment types. Extensive model evaluations and feature analysis indicate that the system can achieve a high detection rate with good adaptation for environment recognition. Empirical evaluation of the proposed method has been verified on the HASC-2016 public dataset, and results show 99% accuracy to detect environment types. The proposed method relies only on the daily life activities data and does not need any external facilities such as the signal cell tower or Wi-Fi access points. This implies the applicability of the proposed method for the upper layer applications.

*abstract:* The objective of this paper is to predict the future driving risk of crash-involved drivers in Kunshan, China. A systematic machine learning framework is proposed to deal with three critical technical issues: 1. defining driving risk; 2. developing risky driving factors; 3. developing a reliable and explicable machine learning model. High-risk (HR) and low-risk (LR) drivers were defined by five different scenarios. A number of features were extracted from seven-year crash/violation records. Drivers' two-year prior crash/violation information was used to predict their driving risk in the subsequent two years. Using a one-year rolling time window, prediction models were developed for four consecutive time periods: 2013⁻2014, 2014⁻2015, 2015⁻2016, and 2016⁻2017. Four tree-based ensemble learning techniques were attempted, including random forest (RF), Adaboost with decision tree, gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), and extreme gradient boosting decision tree (XGboost). A temporal transferability test and a follow-up study were applied to validate the trained models. The best scenario defining driving risk was multi-dimensional, encompassing crash recurrence, severity, and fault commitment. GBDT appeared to be the best model choice across all time periods, with an acceptable average precision (AP) of 0.68 on the most recent datasets (i.e., 2016⁻2017). Seven of nine top features were related to risky driving behaviors, which presented non-linear relationships with driving risk. Model transferability held within relatively short time intervals (1⁻2 years). Appropriate risk definition, complicated violation/crash features, and advanced machine learning techniques need to be considered for risk prediction task. The proposed machine learning approach is promising, so that safety interventions can be launched more effectively.

*abstract:* The interest in fisheye cameras has recently risen in the autonomous vehicles field, as they are able to reduce the complexity of perception systems while improving the management of dangerous driving situations. However, the strong distortion inherent to these cameras makes the usage of conventional computer vision algorithms difficult and has prevented the development of these devices. This paper presents a methodology that provides real-time semantic segmentation on fisheye cameras leveraging only synthetic images. Furthermore, we propose some Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) architectures based on Efficient Residual Factorized Network(ERFNet) that demonstrate notable skills handling distortion and a new training strategy that improves the segmentation on the image borders. Our proposals are compared to similar state-of-the-art works showing an outstanding performance and tested in an unknown real world scenario using a fisheye camera integrated in an open-source autonomous electric car, showing a high domain adaptation capability.

*abstract:* Modern smartphones and wearables often contain multiple embedded sensors which generate significant amounts of data. This information can be used for body monitoring-based areas such as healthcare, indoor location, user-adaptive recommendations and transportation. The development of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) algorithms involves the collection of a large amount of labelled data which should be annotated by an expert. However, the data annotation process on large datasets is expensive, time consuming and difficult to obtain. The development of a HAR approach which requires low annotation effort and still maintains adequate performance is a relevant challenge. We introduce a Semi-Supervised Active Learning (SSAL) based on Self-Training (ST) approach for Human Activity Recognition to partially automate the annotation process, reducing the annotation effort and the required volume of annotated data to obtain a high performance classifier. Our approach uses a criterion to select the most relevant samples for annotation by the expert and propagate their label to the most confident samples. We present a comprehensive study comparing supervised and unsupervised methods with our approach on two datasets composed of daily living activities. The results showed that it is possible to reduce the required annotated data by more than 89% while still maintaining an accurate model performance.

An Artificial Intelligence system was developed and implemented for water,
wastewater, and reuse plants to improve management of sensors, short and
long-term maintenance plans, asset and investment management plans. It is based
on an integrated approach to capture data from different computer systems and
files. It adds a layer of intelligence to the data. It serves as a repository of 
key current and future operations and maintenance conditions that a plant needs
have knowledge of. With this information, it can simulate the configuration of
processes and assets for those conditions to improve or optimize operations,
maintenance and asset management, using the IViewOps (Intelligent View of
Operations) model. Based on the optimization through model runs, it is able to
create output files that can feed data to other systems and inform the staff
regarding optimal solutions to the conditions experienced or anticipated in the
future. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.

This Strategic Research Agenda identifies current challenges and needs in
healthcare, illustrates how biomedical imaging and derived data can help to
address these, and aims to stimulate dedicated research funding efforts.Medicine 
is currently moving towards a more tailored, patient-centric approach by
providing personalised solutions for the individual patient. Innovation in
biomedical imaging plays a key role in this process as it addresses the current
needs for individualised prevention, treatment, therapy response monitoring, and 
image-guided surgery.The use of non-invasive biomarkers facilitates better
therapy prediction and monitoring, leading to improved patient outcomes.
Innovative diagnostic imaging technologies provide information about disease
characteristics which, coupled with biological, genetic and -omics data, will
contribute to an individualised diagnosis and therapy approach.In the emerging
field of theranostics, imaging tools together with therapeutic agents enable the 
selection of best treatments and allow tailored therapeutic interventions.For
prenatal monitoring, the use of innovative imaging technologies can ensure an
early detection of malfunctions or disease.The application of biomedical imaging 
for diagnosis and management of lifestyle-induced diseases will help to avoid
disease development through lifestyle changes.Artificial intelligence and machine
learning in imaging will facilitate the improvement of image interpretation and
lead to better disease prediction and therapy planning.As biomedical imaging
technologies and analysis of existing imaging data provide solutions to current
challenges and needs in healthcare, appropriate funding for dedicated research is
needed to implement the innovative approaches for the wellbeing of citizens and
patients.

Recent studies reveal that even the smallest genomes such as viruses evolve
through complex and stochastic processes, and the assumption of independent
alleles is not valid in most applications. Advances in sequencing technologies
produce multiple time-point whole-genome data, which enable potential
interactions between these alleles to be investigated empirically. To investigate
these interactions, we represent alleles as distributed vectors that encode for
relationships with other alleles in the course of evolution and apply artificial 
neural networks to time-sampled whole-genome datasets for feature learning. We
build this platform using methods and algorithms derived from natural language
processing (NLP), and we denote it as the nucleotide skip-gram neural network. We
learn distributed vectors of alleles using the changes in allele frequency of
echovirus 11 in the presence or absence of the disinfectant (ClO2) from the
experimental evolution data. Results from the training using a new open-source
software TensorFlow show that the learned distributed vectors can be clustered
using principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering to reveal a list
of non-synonymous mutations that arise on the structural protein VP1 in
connection to the candidate mutation for ClO2 adaptation. Furthermore, this
method can account for recombination rates by setting the extent of interactions 
as a biological hyper-parameter, and the results show that the most realistic
scenario of mid-range interactions across the genome is most consistent with the 
previous studies.

Objective: Intelligent computer systems are used in diagnosing Multiple Sclerosis
and help physicians in the accurate and timely diagnosis of the disease. This
study focuses on a review of different reasoning techniques and methods used in
intelligent systems to diagnose MS and analyze the application and efficiency of 
different reasoning methods in order to find the most efficient and applicable
methods and techniques for MS diagnosis.
Methods: A complete research was carried out on articles in various electronic
databases based on Mesh vocabulary. 85 articles out of 614 articles published in 
English between 2000 to 2018 were analyzed, 30 of which have been selected based 
on inclusion criteria such as system scope and domain, full description of
reasoning method and system evaluation.
Results: Results indicate that different reasoning methods are used unintelligent
systems of MS diagnosis. In 27% of the studies, the rule-based method was used,
in 20% the fuzzy logic method, in 18%the artificial neural network method, and in
35% other reasoning methods were used. The average sensitivity, specificity and
accuracy of reasoning methods were0.91, 0.77, and 0.86, respectively.
Conclusions: Rule-based, fuzzy-logic and artificial neural network methods have
had more applications in intelligent systems for the diagnosis of MS,
respectively. The highest rate of sensitivity and accuracy indexes is associated 
to the neural network reasoning method at 0.97 and 0.99, respectively .In the
fuzzy logic method, the Kappa rate has been reported as one, which shows full
conformity between software diagnosis and the physician's decision .In some
articles, in order to remove the limitations of the methods and enhance their
efficiency, combinations of different methods are used.

A low-power, high-gain, and low-noise analog front-end (AFE) for wearable
photoplethysmography (PPG) acquisition systems is designed and fabricated in a
0.35 μm CMOS process. A high transimpedance gain of 142 dBΩ and a low
input-referred noise of only 64.2 pArms was achieved. A Sub-Hz filter was
integrated using a pseudo resistor, resulting in a small silicon area. To
mitigate the saturation problem caused by background light (BGL), a BGL
cancellation loop and a new simple automatic gain control block are used to
enhance the dynamic range and improve the linearity of the AFE. The measurement
results show that a DC photocurrent component up-to-10 μA can be rejected and the
PPG output swing can reach 1.42 Vpp at THD < 1%. The chip consumes a total power 
of 14.85 μW using a single 3.3-V power supply. In this work, the small area and
efficiently integrated blocks were used to implement the PPG AFE and the silicon 
area is minimized to 0.8 mm × 0.8 mm.

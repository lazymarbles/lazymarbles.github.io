*abstract:* The unanticipated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detection in the brain of asymptomatic subjects of white matter lesions suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS) has been named as radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS). As the difference between early MS (i.e., clinically isolated syndrome [CIS]) and RIS is the occurrence of a clinical event, it should be logical to improve detection of subclinical form without interfering with MRI as there are radiological diagnostic criteria for that. Our objective was to use machine-learning classification methods to identify morphometric measures that help to discern patients with RIS from those with CIS.

*abstract:* Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a heterogeneous condition associated with a range of brain imaging abnormalities. Early life stress (ELS) contributes to this heterogeneity, but we do not know how a history of ELS influences traditionally defined brain signatures of PTSD. Here, we used a novel machine learning method - evolving partitions to improve classification (EPIC) - to identify shared and unique structural neuroimaging markers of ELS and PTSD in 97 combat-exposed military veterans.

#### [24. Potential roles of artificial intelligence learning and faecal immunochemical testing for prioritisation of colonoscopy in anaemia.](https://doi.org/10.1111/bjh.15776){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Ayling Ruth M, Lewis Stephen J, Cotter Finbarr*

**Journal:** *British journal of haematology*

*abstract:* Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is the most common cause of anaemia and a frequent indication for colonoscopy, although the prevalence of colorectal cancer (CRC) in IDA is low. Measurement of faecal haemoglobin by immunochemical techniques (FIT) is used to detect symptomatic patients. We studied FIT in patients with anaemia attending a gastroenterology clinic in Plymouth and looked at an artificial intelligence (AI) learning algorithm (ColonFlag™) in these patients, together with a cohort who had undergone colonoscopy for IDA in London. Of 592 patients referred on the basis of haemoglobin concentration, 21 (3.5%) had CRC. Using ColonFlag™, rather than haemoglobin concentration, in combination with symptoms, would have resulted in prioritisation of 304 patients for urgent referral rather than 592. One CRC would have been missed but might have been detected by FIT, which was not available in this case. In patients aged <55 years in whom the incidence of CRC is low, 15 rather than 109 patients would have been prioritised for urgent referral with no cancers missed. FIT has a high negative predictive value in IDA so its use may enable some patients to avoid investigation and AI learning may be a more useful trigger than haemoglobin concentration for urgent referral for colonoscopy.

#### [25. Causal Inference When Counterfactuals Depend on the Proportion of All Subjects Exposed.](https://doi.org/10.1111/biom.13034){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Miles Caleb H, Petersen Maya, van der Laan Mark J*

**Journal:** *Biometrics*

*abstract:* The assumption that no subject's exposure affects another subject's outcome, known as the no-interference assumption, has long held a foundational position in the study of causal inference. However, this assumption may be violated in many settings, and in recent years has been relaxed considerably. Often this has been achieved with either the aid of a known underlying network, or the assumption that the population can be partitioned into separate groups, between which there is no interference, and within which each subject's outcome may be affected by all the other subjects in the group via the proportion exposed (the stratified interference assumption). In this paper, we instead consider a complete interference setting, in which each subject affects every other subject's outcome. In particular, we make the stratified interference assumption for a single group consisting of the entire sample. We show that a targeted maximum likelihood estimator for the i.i.d. setting can be used to estimate a class of causal parameters that includes direct effects and overall effects under certain interventions. This estimator remains doubly-robust, semiparametric efficient, and continues to allow for incorporation of machine learning under our model. We conduct a simulation study, and present results from a data application where we study the effect of a nurse-based triage system on the outcomes of patients receiving HIV care in Kenyan health clinics.This article is protected by copyright.

#### [26. Breast cancer detection using deep convolutional neural networks and support vector machines.](https://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.6201){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Ragab Dina A, Sharkas Maha, Marshall Stephen, Ren Jinchang*

**Journal:** *PeerJ*

*abstract:* It is important to detect breast cancer as early as possible. In this manuscript, a new methodology for classifying breast cancer using deep learning and some segmentation techniques are introduced. A new computer aided detection (CAD) system is proposed for classifying benign and malignant mass tumors in breast mammography images. In this CAD system, two segmentation approaches are used. The first approach involves determining the region of interest (ROI) manually, while the second approach uses the technique of threshold and region based. The deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is used for feature extraction. A well-known DCNN architecture named AlexNet is used and is fine-tuned to classify two classes instead of 1,000 classes. The last fully connected (fc) layer is connected to the support vector machine (SVM) classifier to obtain better accuracy. The results are obtained using the following publicly available datasets (1) the digital database for screening mammography (DDSM); and (2) the Curated Breast Imaging Subset of DDSM (CBIS-DDSM). Training on a large number of data gives high accuracy rate. Nevertheless, the biomedical datasets contain a relatively small number of samples due to limited patient volume. Accordingly, data augmentation is a method for increasing the size of the input data by generating new data from the original input data. There are many forms for the data augmentation; the one used here is the rotation. The accuracy of the new-trained DCNN architecture is 71.01% when cropping the ROI manually from the mammogram. The highest area under the curve (AUC) achieved was 0.88 (88%) for the samples obtained from both segmentation techniques. Moreover, when using the samples obtained from the CBIS-DDSM, the accuracy of the DCNN is increased to 73.6%. Consequently, the SVM accuracy becomes 87.2% with an AUC equaling to 0.94 (94%). This is the highest AUC value compared to previous work using the same conditions.

#### [27. A Novel Protein Subcellular Localization Method With CNN-XGBoost Model for Alzheimer's Disease.](https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2018.00751){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Pang Long, Wang Junjie, Zhao Lingling, Wang Chunyu, Zhan Hui*

**Journal:** *Frontiers in genetics*

*abstract:* The disorder distribution of protein in the compartment or organelle leads to many human diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. The prediction of protein subcellular localization play important roles in the understanding of the mechanism of protein function, pathogenes and disease therapy. This paper proposes a novel subcellular localization method by integrating the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), where CNN acts as a feature extractor to automatically obtain features from the original sequence information and a XGBoost classifier as a recognizer to identify the protein subcellular localization based on the output of the CNN. Experiments are implemented on three protein datasets. The results prove that the CNN-XGBoost method performs better than the general protein subcellular localization methods.

*abstract:* Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-only radiotherapy treatment planning is attractive since MRI provides superior soft tissue contrast over computed tomographies (CTs), without the ionizing radiation exposure. However, it requires the generation of a synthetic CT (SCT) from MRIs for patient setup and dose calculation. In this study, we aim to investigate the accuracy of dose calculation in prostate cancer radiotherapy using SCTs generated from MRIs using our learning-based method. We retrospectively investigated a total of 17 treatment plans from 10 patients, each having both planning CTs (pCT) and MRIs acquired before treatment. The SCT was registered to the pCT for generating SCT-based treatment plans. The original pCT-based plans served as ground truth. Clinically-relevant dose volume histogram (DVH) metrics were extracted from both ground truth and SCT-based plans for comparison and evaluation. Gamma analysis was performed for the comparison of absorbed dose distributions between SCT- and pCT-based plans of each patient. Gamma analysis of dose distribution on pCT and SCT within 1%/1 mm at 10% dose threshold showed greater than 99% pass rate. The average differences in DVH metrics for planning target volumes (PTVs) were less than 1%, and similar metrics for organs at risk (OAR) were not statistically different. The SCT images created from MR images using our proposed machine learning method are accurate for dose calculation in prostate cancer radiation treatment planning. This study also demonstrates the great potential for MRI to completely replace CT scans in the process of simulation and treatment planning. However, MR images are needed to further analyze geometric distortion effects. Digitally reconstructed radiograph (DRR) can be generated within our method, and their accuracy in patient setup needs further analysis.

**Authors:** *Wu Chieh-Chen, Yeh Wen-Chun, Hsu Wen-Ding, Islam Md Mohaimenul, Nguyen Phung Anh Alex, Poly Tahmina Nasrin, Wang Yao-Chin, Yang Hsuan-Chia, Jack Li Yu-Chuan*

**Journal:** *Computer methods and programs in biomedicine*

*abstract:* Fatty liver disease (FLD) is a common clinical complication; it is associated with high morbidity and mortality. However, an early prediction of FLD patients provides an opportunity to make an appropriate strategy for prevention, early diagnosis and treatment. We aimed to develop a machine learning model to predict FLD that could assist physicians in classifying high-risk patients and make a novel diagnosis, prevent and manage FLD.

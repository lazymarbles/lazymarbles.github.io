*abstract:* A substantial proportion of patients with functional neurological disorders (FND) are being incorrectly diagnosed with epilepsy because their semiology resembles that of epileptic seizures (ES). Misdiagnosis may lead to unnecessary treatment and its associated complications. Diagnostic errors often result from an over-reliance on specific clinical features. Furthermore, the lack of electrophysiological changes in patients with FND can also be seen in some forms of epilepsy, making diagnosis extremely challenging. Therefore, understanding semiology is an essential step for differentiating between ES and FND. Existing sensor-based and marker-based systems require physical contact with the body and are vulnerable to clinical situations such as patient positions, illumination changes and motion discontinuities. Computer vision and deep learning are advancing to overcome these limitations encountered in the assessment of diseases and patient monitoring; however, they have not been investigated for seizure disorder scenarios. Here, we propose and compare two marker-free deep learning models, a landmark-based and a region-based model, both of which are capable of distinguishing between seizures from video recordings. We quantify semiology by using either a fusion of reference points and flow fields, or through the complete analysis of the body. Average leave-onesubject-out cross-validation accuracies for the landmark-based and region-based approaches of 68.1% and 79.6% in our dataset collected from 35 patients, reveal the benefit of video analytics to support automated identification of semiology in the challenging conditions of a hospital setting.

*abstract:* As nontechnical losses in power systems have recently become a global concern, electricity fraud detection models attracted increasing academic interest. The wide application of smart meters has offered more possibility to detecting fraud from user's consumption patterns. However, the performances of existing consumption-based electricity fraud detection models are still not satisfactory enough for practice, partly due to their limited ability to handle high-dimensional data. In this paper, a deep-learning-based model is developed for detecting electricity fraud in the advanced metering infrastructure, namely, the multitask feature extracting fraud detector (MFEFD). The deep architecture has brought MFEFD a powerful ability to handle high-dimensional input, through which consumption patterns inside load profiles can be effectively extracted. Another challenge is that the insufficiency of labeled data has restricted the generalization of existing models since they are mostly based on supervised learning and labeled data. MFEFD is trained in a semisupervised manner, in which multitask training was implemented to combine the supervised and unsupervised training, so that both the knowledge from unlabeled and labeled data can be made use of. Real-world-data-based case studies have demonstrated MFEFD's high detection performance, robustness, privacy preservation, and practicability.

*abstract:* In recent years, deep learning algorithms have become increasingly more prominent for their unparalleled ability to automatically learn discriminant features from large amounts of data. However, within the field of electromyographybased gesture recognition, deep learning algorithms are seldom employed as they require an unreasonable amount of effort from a single person, to generate tens of thousands of examples. This work's hypothesis is that general, informative features can be learned from the large amounts of data generated by aggregating the signals of multiple users, thus reducing the recording burden while enhancing gesture recognition. Consequently, this paper proposes applying transfer learning on aggregated data from multiple users, while leveraging the capacity of deep learning algorithms to learn discriminant features from large datasets. Two datasets comprised of 19 and 17 able-bodied participants respectively (the first one is employed for pre-training) were recorded for this work, using the Myo Armband. A third Myo Armband dataset was taken from the NinaPro database and is comprised of 10 able-bodied participants. Three different deep learning networks employing three different modalities as input (raw EMG, Spectrograms and Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT)) are tested on the second and third dataset. The proposed transfer learning scheme is shown to systematically and significantly enhance the performance for all three networks on the two datasets, achieving an offline accuracy of 98.31% for 7 gestures over 17 participants for the CWT-based ConvNet and 68.98% for 18 gestures over 10 participants for the raw EMG-based ConvNet. Finally, a use-case study employing eight able-bodied participants suggests that real-time feedback allows users to adapt their muscle activation strategy which reduces the degradation in accuracy normally experienced over time.

## 14. VoxSegNet: Volumetric CNNs for Semantic Part Segmentation of 3D Shapes.

*abstract:* Volumetric representation has been widely used for 3D deep learning in shape analysis due to its generalization ability and regular data format. However, for fine-grained tasks like part segmentation, volumetric data has not been widely adopted compared to other representations. Aiming at delivering an effective volumetric method for 3D shape part segmentation, this paper proposes a novel volumetric convolutional neural network. Our method can extract discriminative features encoding detailed information from voxelized 3D data under limited resolution. To this purpose, a spatial dense extraction (SDE) module is designed to preserve spatial resolution during feature extraction procedure, alleviating the loss of details caused by sub-sampling operations such as max pooling. An attention feature aggregation (AFA) module is also introduced to adaptively select informative features from different abstraction levels, leading to segmentation with both semantic consistency and high accuracy of details. Experimental results demonstrate that promising results can be achieved by using volumetric data, with part segmentation accuracy comparable or superior to state-of-the-art non-volumetric methods.

## 15. Content-Aware Convolutional Neural Network for In-loop Filtering in High Efficiency Video Coding.

*abstract:* Recently, convolutional neural network (CNN) has attracted tremendous attention and achieved great success in many image processing tasks. In this paper, we focus on CNN technology joining with image restoration to facilitate video coding performance, and propose the content-aware CNN based in-loop filtering for High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC). In particular, we quantitatively analyze the structure of the proposed CNN model from multiple dimensions to make the model interpretable and optimal for CNN based loop filtering. More specifically, each Coding Tree Unit (CTU) is treated as an independent region for processing, such that the proposed content-aware multimodel filtering mechanism is realized by the restoration of different regions with different CNN models under the guidance of the discriminative network. To adapt the image content, the discriminative neural network is learned to analyse the content characteristics of each region for the adaptive selection of the deep learning model. The CTU level control is also enabled in the sense of rate-distortion optimization (RDO). To learn the CNN model, an iterative training method is proposed by simultaneously labeling filter categories at CTU level and finetuning the CNN model parameters. The CNN based in-loop filter is implemented after sample adaptive offset (SAO) in HEVC, and extensive experiments show that the proposed approach significantly improves the coding performance and achieves up to 10.0% bit-rate reduction. On average 4.2%, 6.0%, 4.7% and 5.9% bit-rate reduction can be obtained under all intra, low delay, low delay P and random access configurations, respectively.

## 16. Generative Adversarial Networks and Perceptual Losses for Video Super-Resolution.

*abstract:* Video super-resolution (VSR) has become one of the most critical problems in video processing. In the deep learning literature, recent works have shown the benefits of using adversarial-based and perceptual losses to improve the performance on various image restoration tasks; however, these have yet to be applied for video super-resolution. In this work, we propose a Generative Adversarial Network(GAN)-based formulation for VSR. We introduce a new generator network optimized for the VSR problem, named VSRResNet, along with a new discriminator architecture to properly guide VSRResNet during the GAN training. We further enhance our VSR GAN formulation with two regularizers, a distance loss in featurespace and pixel-space, to obtain our final VSRResFeatGAN model. We show that pre-training our generator with the Mean- Squared-Error loss only quantitatively surpasses the current state-of-the-art VSR models. Finally, we employ the PercepDist metric ([2]) to compare state-of-the-art VSR models. We show that this metric more accurately evaluates the perceptual quality of SR solutions obtained from neural networks, compared with the commonly used PSNR/SSIM metrics. Finally, we show that our proposed model, the VSRResFeatGAN model, outperforms current state-of-the-art SR models, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

## 17. Robust Single-shot T 2 Mapping via Multiple Overlapping-Echo Acquisition and Deep Neural Network.

*abstract:* Quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is of great value to both clinical diagnosis and scientific research. However, most MRI experiments remain qualitative, especially dynamic MRI, because repeated sampling with variable weighting parameter makes quantitative imaging time consuming and sensitive to motion artifacts. A single-shot quantitative T2 mapping method based on multiple overlapping-echo acquisition (dubbed MOLED-4) was proposed to obtain reliable T2 mapping in milliseconds. Different from traditional MRI acceleration methods, such as compressed sensing and parallel imaging, MOLED-4 accelerates quantitative T2 mapping via synchronized multisampling and then deep learning to map the complex nonlinear relationship that is difficult to solve by traditional optimization-based method. The results of simulation, phantom and in vivo human brain experiments show the great performance of the proposed method. The principle of MOLED-4 may be extended to other ultrafast quantitative parameter mappings, and potentially lead to new dynamic MRI with high efficiency to catch quantitative variation of tissue properties.

*abstract:* Modeling human cognition is challenging because there are infinitely many mechanisms that can generate any given observation. Some researchers address this by constraining the hypothesis space through assumptions about what the human mind can and cannot do, while others constrain it through principles of rationality and adaptation. Recent work in economics, psychology, neuroscience, and linguistics has begun to integrate both approaches by augmenting rational models with cognitive constraints, incorporating rational principles into cognitive architectures, and applying optimality principles to understanding neural representations. We identify the rational use of limited resources as a unifying principle underlying these diverse approaches, expressing it in a new cognitive modeling paradigm called resource-rational analysis. The integration of rational principles with realistic cognitive constraints makes resource-rational analysis a promising framework for reverse-engineering cognitive mechanisms and representations. It has already shed new light on the debate about human rationality and can be leveraged to revisit classic questions of cognitive psychology within a principled computational framework. We demonstrate that resource-rational models can reconcile the mind's most impressive cognitive skills with people's ostensive irrationality. Resource-rational analysis also provides a new way to connect psychological theory more deeply with artificial intelligence, economics, neuroscience, and linguistics.

*abstract:* The global connectivities in very large protein similarity networks contain traces of evolution among the proteins for detecting protein remote evolutionary relations or structural similarities. To investigate how well a protein network captures the evolutionary information, a key limitation is the intensive computation of pairwise sequence similarities needed to construct very large protein networks. In this paper, we introduce Label Propagation on Low-rank Kernel Approximation (LP-LOKA) for searching massively large protein networks. LP-LOKA propagates initial protein similarities in a low-rank graph by Nyström approximation without computing all pairwise similarities. With scalable parallel implementations based on distributed-memory using message-passing interface and Apache-Hadoop/Spark on cloud, LP-LOKA can search protein networks with one million proteins or more. In the experiments on Swiss-Prot/ADDA/CASP data, LP-LOKA significantly improved protein ranking over the widely used HMM-HMM or profile-sequence alignment methods utilizing large protein networks. It was observed that the larger the protein similarity network, the better the performance, especially on relatively small protein superfamilies and folds. The results suggest that computing massively large protein network is necessary to meet the growing need of annotating proteins from newly sequenced species and LP-LOKA is both scalable and accurate for searching massively large protein networks.

*abstract:* The unanticipated magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detection in the brain of asymptomatic subjects of white matter lesions suggestive of multiple sclerosis (MS) has been named as radiologically isolated syndrome (RIS). As the difference between early MS (i.e., clinically isolated syndrome [CIS]) and RIS is the occurrence of a clinical event, it should be logical to improve detection of subclinical form without interfering with MRI as there are radiological diagnostic criteria for that. Our objective was to use machine-learning classification methods to identify morphometric measures that help to discern patients with RIS from those with CIS.

*abstract:* Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a heterogeneous condition associated with a range of brain imaging abnormalities. Early life stress (ELS) contributes to this heterogeneity, but we do not know how a history of ELS influences traditionally defined brain signatures of PTSD. Here, we used a novel machine learning method - evolving partitions to improve classification (EPIC) - to identify shared and unique structural neuroimaging markers of ELS and PTSD in 97 combat-exposed military veterans.

*abstract:* Iron deficiency anaemia (IDA) is the most common cause of anaemia and a frequent indication for colonoscopy, although the prevalence of colorectal cancer (CRC) in IDA is low. Measurement of faecal haemoglobin by immunochemical techniques (FIT) is used to detect symptomatic patients. We studied FIT in patients with anaemia attending a gastroenterology clinic in Plymouth and looked at an artificial intelligence (AI) learning algorithm (ColonFlag™) in these patients, together with a cohort who had undergone colonoscopy for IDA in London. Of 592 patients referred on the basis of haemoglobin concentration, 21 (3.5%) had CRC. Using ColonFlag™, rather than haemoglobin concentration, in combination with symptoms, would have resulted in prioritisation of 304 patients for urgent referral rather than 592. One CRC would have been missed but might have been detected by FIT, which was not available in this case. In patients aged <55 years in whom the incidence of CRC is low, 15 rather than 109 patients would have been prioritised for urgent referral with no cancers missed. FIT has a high negative predictive value in IDA so its use may enable some patients to avoid investigation and AI learning may be a more useful trigger than haemoglobin concentration for urgent referral for colonoscopy.

*abstract:* The assumption that no subject's exposure affects another subject's outcome, known as the no-interference assumption, has long held a foundational position in the study of causal inference. However, this assumption may be violated in many settings, and in recent years has been relaxed considerably. Often this has been achieved with either the aid of a known underlying network, or the assumption that the population can be partitioned into separate groups, between which there is no interference, and within which each subject's outcome may be affected by all the other subjects in the group via the proportion exposed (the stratified interference assumption). In this paper, we instead consider a complete interference setting, in which each subject affects every other subject's outcome. In particular, we make the stratified interference assumption for a single group consisting of the entire sample. We show that a targeted maximum likelihood estimator for the i.i.d. setting can be used to estimate a class of causal parameters that includes direct effects and overall effects under certain interventions. This estimator remains doubly-robust, semiparametric efficient, and continues to allow for incorporation of machine learning under our model. We conduct a simulation study, and present results from a data application where we study the effect of a nurse-based triage system on the outcomes of patients receiving HIV care in Kenyan health clinics.This article is protected by copyright.

*abstract:* It is important to detect breast cancer as early as possible. In this manuscript, a new methodology for classifying breast cancer using deep learning and some segmentation techniques are introduced. A new computer aided detection (CAD) system is proposed for classifying benign and malignant mass tumors in breast mammography images. In this CAD system, two segmentation approaches are used. The first approach involves determining the region of interest (ROI) manually, while the second approach uses the technique of threshold and region based. The deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is used for feature extraction. A well-known DCNN architecture named AlexNet is used and is fine-tuned to classify two classes instead of 1,000 classes. The last fully connected (fc) layer is connected to the support vector machine (SVM) classifier to obtain better accuracy. The results are obtained using the following publicly available datasets (1) the digital database for screening mammography (DDSM); and (2) the Curated Breast Imaging Subset of DDSM (CBIS-DDSM). Training on a large number of data gives high accuracy rate. Nevertheless, the biomedical datasets contain a relatively small number of samples due to limited patient volume. Accordingly, data augmentation is a method for increasing the size of the input data by generating new data from the original input data. There are many forms for the data augmentation; the one used here is the rotation. The accuracy of the new-trained DCNN architecture is 71.01% when cropping the ROI manually from the mammogram. The highest area under the curve (AUC) achieved was 0.88 (88%) for the samples obtained from both segmentation techniques. Moreover, when using the samples obtained from the CBIS-DDSM, the accuracy of the DCNN is increased to 73.6%. Consequently, the SVM accuracy becomes 87.2% with an AUC equaling to 0.94 (94%). This is the highest AUC value compared to previous work using the same conditions.

## 28. A Novel Protein Subcellular Localization Method With CNN-XGBoost Model for Alzheimer's Disease.

*abstract:* The disorder distribution of protein in the compartment or organelle leads to many human diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. The prediction of protein subcellular localization play important roles in the understanding of the mechanism of protein function, pathogenes and disease therapy. This paper proposes a novel subcellular localization method by integrating the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), where CNN acts as a feature extractor to automatically obtain features from the original sequence information and a XGBoost classifier as a recognizer to identify the protein subcellular localization based on the output of the CNN. Experiments are implemented on three protein datasets. The results prove that the CNN-XGBoost method performs better than the general protein subcellular localization methods.

*abstract:* Accurately determining pain levels in children is difficult, even for trained professionals and parents. Facial activity provides sensitive and specific information about pain, and computer vision algorithms have been developed to automatically detect Facial Action Units (AUs) defined by the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). Our prior work utilized information from computer vision, i.e., automatically detected facial AUs, to develop classifiers to distinguish between pain and no-pain conditions. However, application of pain/no-pain classifiers based on automated AU codings across different environmental domains results in diminished performance. In contrast, classifiers based on manually coded AUs demonstrate reduced environmentally-based variability in performance. In this paper, we train a machine learning model to recognize pain using AUs coded by a computer vision system embedded in a software package called iMotions. We also study the relationship between iMotions (automatically) and human (manually) coded AUs. We find that AUs coded automatically are different from those coded by a human trained in the FACS system, and that the human coder is less sensitive to environmental changes. To improve classification performance in the current work, we applied transfer learning by training another machine learning model to map automated AU codings to a subspace of manual AU codings to enable more robust pain recognition performance when only automatically coded AUs are available for the test data. With this transfer learning method, we improved the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) on independent data from new participants in our target domain from 0.67 to 0.72.

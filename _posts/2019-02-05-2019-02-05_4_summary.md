*abstract:* Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-only radiotherapy treatment planning is attractive since MRI provides superior soft tissue contrast over computed tomographies (CTs), without the ionizing radiation exposure. However, it requires the generation of a synthetic CT (SCT) from MRIs for patient setup and dose calculation. In this study, we aim to investigate the accuracy of dose calculation in prostate cancer radiotherapy using SCTs generated from MRIs using our learning-based method. We retrospectively investigated a total of 17 treatment plans from 10 patients, each having both planning CTs (pCT) and MRIs acquired before treatment. The SCT was registered to the pCT for generating SCT-based treatment plans. The original pCT-based plans served as ground truth. Clinically-relevant dose volume histogram (DVH) metrics were extracted from both ground truth and SCT-based plans for comparison and evaluation. Gamma analysis was performed for the comparison of absorbed dose distributions between SCT- and pCT-based plans of each patient. Gamma analysis of dose distribution on pCT and SCT within 1%/1 mm at 10% dose threshold showed greater than 99% pass rate. The average differences in DVH metrics for planning target volumes (PTVs) were less than 1%, and similar metrics for organs at risk (OAR) were not statistically different. The SCT images created from MR images using our proposed machine learning method are accurate for dose calculation in prostate cancer radiation treatment planning. This study also demonstrates the great potential for MRI to completely replace CT scans in the process of simulation and treatment planning. However, MR images are needed to further analyze geometric distortion effects. Digitally reconstructed radiograph (DRR) can be generated within our method, and their accuracy in patient setup needs further analysis.

*abstract:* Fatty liver disease (FLD) is a common clinical complication; it is associated with high morbidity and mortality. However, an early prediction of FLD patients provides an opportunity to make an appropriate strategy for prevention, early diagnosis and treatment. We aimed to develop a machine learning model to predict FLD that could assist physicians in classifying high-risk patients and make a novel diagnosis, prevent and manage FLD.

*abstract:* Sepsis is a common and major health crisis in hospitals globally. An innovative and feasible tool for predicting sepsis remains elusive. However, early and accurate prediction of sepsis could help physicians with proper treatments and minimize the diagnostic uncertainty. Machine learning models could help to identify potential clinical variables and provide higher performance than existing traditional low-performance models. We therefore performed a meta-analysis of observational studies to quantify the performance of a machine learning model to predict sepsis.

*abstract:* The sixth International Conference on Intelligent Biology and Medicine (ICIBM) took place in Los Angeles, California, USA on June 10-12, 2018. This conference featured eleven regular scientific sessions, four tutorials, one poster session, four keynote talks, and four eminent scholar talks. The scientific program covered a wide range of topics from bench to bedside, including 3D Genome Organization, reconstruction of large scale evolution of genomes and gene functions, artificial intelligence in biological and biomedical fields, and precision medicine. Both method development and application in genomic research continued to be a main component in the conference, including studies on genetic variants, regulation of transcription, genetic-epigenetic interaction at both single cell and tissue level and artificial intelligence. Here, we write a summary of the conference and also briefly introduce the four high quality papers selected to be published in BMC Genomics that cover novel methodology development or innovative data analysis.

*abstract:* Existing functional description of genes are categorical, discrete, and mostly through manual process. In this work, we explore the idea of gene embedding, distributed representation of genes, in the spirit of word embedding.

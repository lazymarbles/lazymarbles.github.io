*abstract:* To design and assess a method to leverage individuals' temporal data for predicting their healthcare cost. To achieve this goal, we first used patients' temporal data in their fine-grain form as opposed to coarse-grain form. Second, we devised novel spike detection features to extract temporal patterns that improve the performance of cost prediction. Third, we evaluated the effectiveness of different types of temporal features based on cost information, visit information and medical information for the prediction task.

*abstract:* Virtual reality (VR) has recently become an affordable technology. A wide range of options are available to access this unique visualisation medium, from simple cardboard inserts for smartphones to truly advanced headsets tracked by external sensors. While it is now possible for any research team to gain access to VR, we can still question what it brings to scientific research. Visualisation and the ability to navigate complex three-dimensional data is undoubtedly a gateway to many scientific applications, however, we are convinced that data treatment and numerical simulations, especially those mixing interactions with data, human cognition and automated algorithms will be the future of VR in scientific research. Moreover, VR might soon merit the same level of attention to imaging data as machine learning currently has. In this short perspective we discuss approaches that employ VR in scientific research based on some concrete examples.

**Journal:** *Allergy*

*abstract:* Associations between childhood asthma phenotypes and genetic, immunological and environmental factors have been previously established. Yet, strategies to integrate high-dimensional risk factors from multiple distinct data sets, and thereby increase the statistical power of analyses, have been hampered by a preponderance of missing data and lack of methods to accommodate them.

**Authors:** *Yao Jin, Hurle Mark R, Nelson Matthew R, Agarwal Pankaj*

**Journal:** *BMC bioinformatics*

*abstract:* Determining which target to pursue is a challenging and error-prone first step in developing a therapeutic treatment for a disease, where missteps are potentially very costly given the long-time frames and high expenses of drug development. With current informatics technology and machine learning algorithms, it is now possible to computationally discover therapeutic hypotheses by predicting clinically promising drug targets based on the evidence associating drug targets with disease indications. We have collected this evidence from Open Targets and additional databases that covers 17 sources of evidence for target-indication association and represented the data as a tensor of 21,437 × 2211 × 17.

*abstract:* While ship detection using high-resolution optical satellite images plays an important role in various civilian fields-including maritime traffic survey and maritime rescue-it is a difficult task due to influences of the complex background, especially when ships are near to land. In current literatures, land masking is generally required before ship detection to avoid many false alarms on land. However, sea⁻land segmentation not only has the risk of segmentation errors, but also requires expertise to adjust parameters. In this study, Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (Faster R-CNN) is applied to detect ships without the need for land masking. We propose an effective training strategy for the Faster R-CNN by incorporating a large number of images containing only terrestrial regions as negative samples without any manual marking, which is different from the selection of negative samples by targeted way in other detection methods. The experiments using Gaofen-1 satellite (GF-1), Gaofen-2 satellite (GF-2), and Jilin-1 satellite (JL-1) images as testing datasets under different ship detection conditions were carried out to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in the avoidance of false alarms on land. The results show that the method incorporating negative sample training can largely reduce false alarms in terrestrial areas, and is superior in detection performance, algorithm complexity, and time consumption. Compared with the method based on sea⁻land segmentation, the proposed method achieves the absolute increment of 70% of the F1-measure, when the image contains large land area such as the GF-1 image, and achieves the absolute increment of 42.5% for images with complex harbors and many coastal ships, such as the JL-1 images.

**Authors:** *Lin Yi, Tan Xianlong, Yang Bo, Yang Kai, Zhang Jianwei, Yu Jing*

**Journal:** *Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)*

*abstract:* In order to obtain real-time controlling dynamics in air traffic system, a framework is proposed to introduce and process air traffic control (ATC) speech via radiotelephony communication. An automatic speech recognition (ASR) and controlling instruction understanding (CIU)-based pipeline is designed to convert the ATC speech into ATC related elements, i.e., controlling intent and parameters. A correction procedure is also proposed to improve the reliability of the information obtained by the proposed framework. In the ASR model, acoustic model (AM), pronunciation model (PM), and phoneme- and word-based language model (LM) are proposed to unify multilingual ASR into one model. In this work, based on their tasks, the AM and PM are defined as speech recognition and machine translation problems respectively. Two-dimensional convolution and average-pooling layers are designed to solve special challenges of ASR in ATC. An encoder⁻decoder architecture-based neural network is proposed to translate phoneme labels into word labels, which achieves the purpose of ASR. In the CIU model, a recurrent neural network-based joint model is proposed to detect the controlling intent and label the controlling parameters, in which the two tasks are solved in one network to enhance the performance with each other based on ATC communication rules. The ATC speech is now converted into ATC related elements by the proposed ASR and CIU model. To further improve the accuracy of the sensing framework, a correction procedure is proposed to revise minor mistakes in ASR decoding results based on the flight information, such as flight plan, ADS-B. The proposed models are trained using real operating data and applied to a civil aviation airport in China to evaluate their performance. Experimental results show that the proposed framework can obtain real-time controlling dynamics with high performance, only 4% word-error rate. Meanwhile, the decoding efficiency can also meet the requirement of real-time applications, i.e., an average 0.147 real time factor. With the proposed framework and obtained traffic dynamics, current ATC applications can be accomplished with higher accuracy. In addition, the proposed ASR pipeline has high reusability, which allows us to apply it to other controlling scenes and languages with minor changes.

**Journal:** *Brain sciences*

*abstract:* Quantifying gait and postural control adds valuable information that aids in understanding neurological conditions where motor symptoms predominate and cause considerable functional impairment. Disease-specific clinical scales exist; however, they are often susceptible to subjectivity, and can lack sensitivity when identifying subtle gait and postural impairments in prodromal cohorts and longitudinally to document disease progression. Numerous devices are available to objectively quantify a range of measurement outcomes pertaining to gait and postural control; however, efforts are required to standardise and harmonise approaches that are specific to the neurological condition and clinical assessment. Tools are urgently needed that address a number of unmet needs in neurological practice. Namely, these include timely and accurate diagnosis; disease stratification; risk prediction; tracking disease progression; and decision making for intervention optimisation and maximising therapeutic response (such as medication selection, disease staging, and targeted support). Using some recent examples of research across a range of relevant neurological conditions-including Parkinson's disease, ataxia, and dementia-we will illustrate evidence that supports progress against these unmet clinical needs. We summarise the novel 'big data' approaches that utilise data mining and machine learning techniques to improve disease classification and risk prediction, and conclude with recommendations for future direction.

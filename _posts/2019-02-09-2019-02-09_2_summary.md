#### [14. Artificial intelligence systems for complex decision-making in acute care medicine: a review.](https://pssjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13037-019-0188-2){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Lynn Lawrence A*

**Journal:** *Patient safety in surgery*

*abstract:* The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into acute care brings a new source of intellectual thought to the bedside. This offers great potential for synergy between AI systems and the human intellect already delivering care. This much needed help should be embraced, if proven effective. However, there is a risk that the present role of physicians and nurses as the primary arbiters of acute care in hospitals may be overtaken by computers. While many argue that this transition is inevitable, the process of developing a formal plan to prevent the need to pass control of patient care to computers should not be further delayed. The first step in the interdiction process is to recognize; the limitations of existing hospital protocols, why we need AI in acute care, and finally how the focus of medical decision making will change with the integration of AI based analysis. The second step is to develop a strategy for changing the focus of medical education to empower physicians to maintain oversight of AI. Physicians, nurses, and experts in the field of safe hospital communication must control the transition to AI integrated care because there is significant risk during the transition period and much of this risk is subtle, unique to the hospital environment, and outside the expertise of AI designers. AI is needed in acute care because AI detects complex relational time-series patterns within datasets and this level of analysis transcends conventional threshold based analysis applied in hospital protocols in use today. For this reason medical education will have to change to provide healthcare workers with the ability to understand and over-read relational time pattern centered communications from AI. Medical education will need to place less emphasis on threshold decision making and a greater focus on detection, analysis, and the pathophysiologic basis of relational time patterns. This should be an early part of a medical student's education because this is what their hospital companion (the AI) will be doing. Effective communication between human and artificial intelligence requires a common pattern centered knowledge base. Experts in safety focused human to human communication in hospitals should lead during this transition process.

**Journal:** *Evolutionary bioinformatics online*

*abstract:* Time is one crucial dimension conveying information in animal communication. Evolution has shaped animals' nervous systems to produce signals with temporal properties fitting their socio-ecological niches. Many quantitative models of mechanisms underlying rhythmic behaviour exist, spanning insects, crustaceans, birds, amphibians, and mammals. However, these computational and mathematical models are often presented in isolation. Here, we provide an overview of the main mathematical models employed in the study of animal rhythmic communication among conspecifics. After presenting basic definitions and mathematical formalisms, we discuss each individual model. These computational models are then compared using simulated data to uncover similarities and key differences in the underlying mechanisms found across species. Our review of the empirical literature is admittedly limited. We stress the need of using comparative computer simulations - both before and after animal experiments - to better understand animal timing in interaction. We hope this article will serve as a potential first step towards a common computational framework to describe temporal interactions in animals, including humans.

#### [16. Machine learning for MEG during speech tasks.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-38612-9){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Kostas Demetres, Pang Elizabeth W, Rudzicz Frank*

**Journal:** *Scientific reports*

*abstract:* We consider whether a deep neural network trained with raw MEG data can be used to predict the age of children performing a verb-generation task, a monosyllable speech-elicitation task, and a multi-syllabic speech-elicitation task. Furthermore, we argue that the network makes predictions on the grounds of differences in speech development. Previous work has explored taking 'deep' neural networks (DNNs) designed for, or trained with, images to classify encephalographic recordings with some success, but this does little to acknowledge the structure of these data. Simple neural networks have been used extensively to classify data expressed as features, but require extensive feature engineering and pre-processing. We present novel DNNs trained using raw magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) recordings that mimic the feature-engineering pipeline. We highlight criteria the networks use, including relative weighting of channels and preferred spectro-temporal characteristics of re-weighted channels. Our data feature 92 subjects aged 4-18, recorded using a 151-channel MEG system. Our proposed model scores over 95% mean cross-validation accuracy distinguishing above and below 10 years of age in single trials of un-seen subjects, and can classify publicly available EEG with state-of-the-art accuracy.

#### [17. Objective risk stratification of prostate cancer using machine learning and radiomics applied to multiparametric magnetic resonance images.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-38381-x){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Varghese Bino, Chen Frank, Hwang Darryl, Palmer Suzanne L, De Castro Abreu Andre Luis, Ukimura Osamu, Aron Monish, Aron Manju, Gill Inderbir, Duddalwar Vinay, Pandey Gaurav*

**Journal:** *Scientific reports*

*abstract:* Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) has become increasingly important for the clinical assessment of prostate cancer (PCa), but its interpretation is generally variable due to its relatively subjective nature. Radiomics and classification methods have shown potential for improving the accuracy and objectivity of mpMRI-based PCa assessment. However, these studies are limited to a small number of classification methods, evaluation using the AUC score only, and a non-rigorous assessment of all possible combinations of radiomics and classification methods. This paper presents a systematic and rigorous framework comprised of classification, cross-validation and statistical analyses that was developed to identify the best performing classifier for PCa risk stratification based on mpMRI-derived radiomic features derived from a sizeable cohort. This classifier performed well in an independent validation set, including performing better than PI-RADS v2 in some aspects, indicating the value of objectively interpreting mpMRI images using radiomics and classification methods for PCa risk assessment.

#### [19. Accurate molecular polarizabilities with coupled cluster theory and machine learning.](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=30733292){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Wilkins David M, Grisafi Andrea, Yang Yang, Lao Ka Un, DiStasio Robert A, Ceriotti Michele*

*abstract:* The molecular dipole polarizability describes the tendency of a molecule to change its dipole moment in response to an applied electric field. This quantity governs key intra- and intermolecular interactions, such as induction and dispersion; plays a vital role in determining the spectroscopic signatures of molecules; and is an essential ingredient in polarizable force fields. Compared with other ground-state properties, an accurate prediction of the molecular polarizability is considerably more difficult, as this response quantity is quite sensitive to the underlying electronic structure description. In this work, we present highly accurate quantum mechanical calculations of the static dipole polarizability tensors of 7,211 small organic molecules computed using linear response coupled cluster singles and doubles theory (LR-CCSD). Using a symmetry-adapted machine-learning approach, we demonstrate that it is possible to predict the LR-CCSD molecular polarizabilities of these small molecules with an error that is an order of magnitude smaller than that of hybrid density functional theory (DFT) at a negligible computational cost. The resultant model is robust and transferable, yielding molecular polarizabilities for a diverse set of 52 larger molecules (including challenging conjugated systems, carbohydrates, small drugs, amino acids, nucleobases, and hydrocarbon isomers) at an accuracy that exceeds that of hybrid DFT. The atom-centered decomposition implicit in our machine-learning approach offers some insight into the shortcomings of DFT in the prediction of this fundamental quantity of interest.

#### [20. Machine-learning approach to the design of OSDAs for zeolite beta.](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=30733290){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Daeyaert Frits, Ye Fengdan, Deem Michael W*

**Journal:** *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America*

*abstract:* We report a machine-learning strategy for design of organic structure directing agents (OSDAs) for zeolite beta. We use machine learning to replace a computationally expensive molecular dynamics evaluation of the stabilization energy of the OSDA inside zeolite beta with a neural network prediction. We train the neural network on 4,781 candidate OSDAs, spanning a range of stabilization energies. We find that the stabilization energies predicted by the neural network are highly correlated with the molecular dynamics computations. We further find that the evolutionary design algorithm samples the space of chemically feasible OSDAs thoroughly. In total, we find 469 OSDAs with verified stabilization energies below -17 kJ/(mol Si), comparable to or better than known OSDAs for zeolite beta, and greatly expanding our previous list of 152 such predicted OSDAs. We expect that these OSDAs will lead to syntheses of zeolite beta.

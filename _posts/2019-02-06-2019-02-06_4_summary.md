**Journal:** *Journal of thoracic imaging*

*abstract:* The purpose of this review article is to acquaint the reader with the current state of the art for the noncardiovascular imaging biomarkers of metabolic syndrome found on noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT) of the chest and their prognostic significance. Routine chest NCCT includes quantitative information with regard to tissue density and organ volumes in the neck, chest, and upper abdomen. The specific imaging biomarkers that may be seen in association with metabolic syndrome include low thyroid iodine organification, hepatic steatosis, sarcopenia (muscle volume and density), demineralization of the thoracic and upper lumbar vertebral bodies, loss of axial skeletal muscle mass, premature lung inflammation, and an increased deposition of subcutaneous and visceral fat. These easily identified imaging biomarkers can have prognostic implications, which include nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, hypothyroidism, early lung fibrosis with interstitial abnormalities, sarcopenia, and osteoporotic thoracic and lumbar spine vertebral body compression fractures. NCCT examinations of the chest have the opportunity to become an important imaging tool for outcomes research.

#### [12. Glassy Phase of Optimal Quantum Control.](http://link.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v122/p020601){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Day Alexandre G R, Bukov Marin, Weinberg Phillip, Mehta Pankaj, Sels Dries*

**Journal:** *Physical review letters*

*abstract:* We study the problem of preparing a quantum many-body system from an initial to a target state by optimizing the fidelity over the family of bang-bang protocols. We present compelling numerical evidence for a universal spin-glasslike transition controlled by the protocol time duration. The glassy critical point is marked by a proliferation of protocols with close-to-optimal fidelity and with a true optimum that appears exponentially difficult to locate. Using a machine learning (ML) inspired framework based on the manifold learning algorithm t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding, we are able to visualize the geometry of the high-dimensional control landscape in an effective low-dimensional representation. Across the transition, the control landscape features an exponential number of clusters separated by extensive barriers, which bears a strong resemblance with replica symmetry breaking in spin glasses and random satisfiability problems. We further show that the quantum control landscape maps onto a disorder-free classical Ising model with frustrated nonlocal, multibody interactions. Our work highlights an intricate but unexpected connection between optimal quantum control and spin glass physics, and shows how tools from ML can be used to visualize and understand glassy optimization landscapes.

**Journal:** *Aging cell*

*abstract:* The decrease in skeletal muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity with age adversely affects muscle strength and physical performance. Factors that are associated with this decrease have not been well characterized. Low plasma lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC), a major class of systemic bioactive lipids, are predictive of aging phenotypes such as cognitive impairment and decline of gait speed in older adults. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that low plasma LPC are associated with impaired skeletal muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity. Skeletal muscle mitochondrial oxidative capacity was measured using in vivo phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (

#### [14. Computer-Assisted Nuclear Atypia Scoring of Breast Cancer: a Preliminary Study.](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10278-019-00181-8){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Gandomkar Ziba, Brennan Patrick C, Mello-Thoms Claudia*

**Journal:** *Journal of digital imaging*

*abstract:* Inter-pathologist agreement for nuclear atypia scoring of breast cancer is poor. To address this problem, previous studies suggested some criteria for describing the variations appearance of tumor cells relative to normal cells. However, these criteria were still assessed subjectively by pathologists. Previous studies used quantitative computer-extracted features for scoring. However, application of these tools is limited as further improvement in their accuracy is required. This study proposes COMPASS (COMputer-assisted analysis combined with Pathologist's ASSessment) for reproducible nuclear atypia scoring. COMPASS relies on both cytological criteria assessed subjectively by pathologists as well as computer-extracted textural features. Using machine learning, COMPASS combines these two sets of features and output nuclear atypia score. COMPASS's performance was evaluated using 300 images for which expert-consensus derived reference nuclear pleomorphism scores were available, and they were scanned by two scanners from different vendors. A personalized model was built for three pathologists who gave scores to six atypia-related criteria for each image. Leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) was used. COMPASS was trained and tested for each pathologist separately. Percentage agreement between COMPASS and the reference nuclear scores was 93.8%, 92.9%, and 93.1% for three pathologists. COMPASS's performance in nuclear grading was almost identical for both scanners, with Cohen's kappa ranging from 0.80 to 0.86 for different pathologists and different scanners. Independently, the images were also assessed by two experienced senior pathologists. Cohen's kappa of COMPASS was comparable to the Cohen's kappa for two senior pathologists (0.79 and 0.68).

**Authors:** *Lee Jang Hyung, Kim Young Jae, Kim Yoon Woo, Park Sungjin, Choi Youn-I, Kim Yoon Jae, Park Dong Kyun, Kim Kwang Gi, Chung Jun-Won*

**Journal:** *Surgical endoscopy*

*abstract:* Gastric cancer is a common kind of malignancies, with yearly occurrences exceeding one million worldwide in 2017. Typically, ulcerous and cancerous tissues develop abnormal morphologies through courses of progression. Endoscopy is a routinely adopted means for examination of gastrointestinal tract for malignancy. Early and timely detection of malignancy closely correlate with good prognosis. Repeated presentation of similar frames from gastrointestinal tract endoscopy often weakens attention for practitioners to result in true patients missed out to incur higher medical cost and unnecessary morbidity. Highly needed is an automatic means for spotting visual abnormality and prompts for attention for medical staff for more thorough examination.

#### [17. High Expression Levels of AGGF1 and MFAP4 Predict Primary Platinum-Based Chemoresistance and are Associated with Adverse Prognosis in Patients with Serous Ovarian Cancer.](http://www.jcancer.org/v10p0397.htm){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Zhao Haiyue, Sun Qian, Li Lisong, Zhou Jinhua, Zhang Cong, Hu Ting, Zhou Xuemei, Zhang Long, Wang Baiyu, Li Bo, Zhu Tao, Li Hong*

**Journal:** *Journal of Cancer*

*abstract:* Primary platinum-based chemoresistance occurs in approximately one-third of patients with serous ovarian cancer (SOC); however, traditional clinical indicators are poor predictors of chemoresistance. So we aimed to identify novel genes as predictors of primary platinum-based chemoresistance. Gene expression microarray analyses were performed to identify the genes related to primary platinum resistance in SOC on two discovery datasets (GSE51373, GSE63885) and one validation dataset (TCGA). Univariate and multivariate analyses with logistic regression were performed to evaluate the predictive values of the genes for platinum resistance. Machine learning algorithms (linear kernel support vector machine and artificial neural network) were applied to build prediction models. Univariate and multivariate analyses with Cox proportional hazards regression and log-rank tests were used to assess the effects of these gene signatures for platinum resistance on prognosis in two independent datasets (GSE9891, GSE32062). AGGF1 and MFAP4 were found highly expressed in patients with platinum-resistant SOC and independently predicted platinum resistance. Platinum resistance prediction models based on these targets had robust predictive power (highest AUC: 0.8056, 95% CI: 0.6338-0.9773; lowest AUC: 0.7245, 95% CI: 0.6052-0.8438). An AGGF1- and MFAP4-centered protein interaction network was built, and hypothetical regulatory pathways were identified. Enrichment analysis indicated that aberrations of extracellular matrix may play important roles in platinum resistance in SOC. High AGGF1 and MFAP4 expression levels were also related to shorter recurrence-free and overall survival in patients with SOC after adjustment for other clinical variables. Therefore, AGGF1 and MFAP4 are potential predictive biomarkers for response to platinum-based chemotherapy and survival outcomes in SOC.

**Journal:** *Computational intelligence and neuroscience*

*abstract:* Preventive maintenance activities require a tool to be offline for long hour in order to perform the prescribed maintenance activities. Although preventive maintenance is crucial to ensure operational reliability and efficiency of the tool, long hour of preventive maintenance activities increases the cycle time of the semiconductor fabrication foundry (Fab). Therefore, this activity is usually performed when the incoming Work-in-Progress to the equipment is forecasted to be low. The current statistical forecasting approach has low accuracy because it lacks the ability to capture the time-dependent behavior of the Work-in-Progress. In this paper, we present a forecasting model that utilizes machine learning method to forecast the incoming Work-In-Progress. Specifically, our proposed model uses LSTM to forecast multistep ahead incoming Work-in-Progress prediction to an equipment group. The proposed model's prediction results were compared with the results of the current statistical forecasting method of the Fab. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed model performed better than the statistical forecasting method in both hit rate and Pearson's correlation coefficient,

#### [19. Persistent Homology for the Quantitative Evaluation of Architectural Features in Prostate Cancer Histology.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-36798-y){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Lawson Peter, Sholl Andrew B, Brown J Quincy, Fasy Brittany Terese, Wenk Carola*

**Journal:** *Scientific reports*

*abstract:* The current system for evaluating prostate cancer architecture is the Gleason grading system which divides the morphology of cancer into five distinct architectural patterns, labeled 1 to 5 in increasing levels of cancer aggressiveness, and generates a score by summing the labels of the two most dominant patterns. The Gleason score is currently the most powerful prognostic predictor of patient outcomes; however, it suffers from problems in reproducibility and consistency due to the high intra-observer and inter-observer variability amongst pathologists. In addition, the Gleason system lacks the granularity to address potentially prognostic architectural features beyond Gleason patterns. We evaluate prostate cancer for architectural subtypes using techniques from topological data analysis applied to prostate cancer glandular architecture. In this work we demonstrate the use of persistent homology to capture architectural features independently of Gleason patterns. Specifically, using persistent homology, we compute topological representations of purely graded prostate cancer histopathology images of Gleason patterns 3,4 and 5, and show that persistent homology is capable of clustering prostate cancer histology into architectural groups through a ranked persistence vector. Our results indicate the ability of persistent homology to cluster prostate cancer histopathology images into unique groups with dominant architectural patterns consistent with the continuum of Gleason patterns. In addition, of particular interest, is the sensitivity of persistent homology to identify specific sub-architectural groups within single Gleason patterns, suggesting that persistent homology could represent a robust quantification method for prostate cancer architecture with higher granularity than the existing semi-quantitative measures. The capability of these topological representations to segregate prostate cancer by architecture makes them an ideal candidate for use as inputs to future machine learning approaches with the intent of augmenting traditional approaches with topological features for improved diagnosis and prognosis.

#### [20. Unsupervised feature extraction of anterior chamber OCT images for ordering and classification.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-38136-8){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Amil Pablo, González Laura, Arrondo Elena, Salinas Cecilia, Guell J L, Masoller Cristina, Parlitz Ulrich*

**Journal:** *Scientific reports*

*abstract:* We propose an image processing method for ordering anterior chamber optical coherence tomography (OCT) images in a fully unsupervised manner. The method consists of three steps: Firstly we preprocess the images (filtering the noise, aligning and normalizing the resolution); secondly, a distance measure between images is computed for every pair of images; thirdly we apply a machine learning algorithm that exploits the distance measure to order the images in a two-dimensional plane. The method is applied to a large (~1000) database of anterior chamber OCT images of healthy subjects and patients with angle-closure and the resulting unsupervised ordering and classification is validated by two ophthalmologists.

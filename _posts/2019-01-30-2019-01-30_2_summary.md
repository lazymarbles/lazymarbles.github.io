*abstract:* Autism spectrum disorder is a developmental disorder that describes certain challenges associated with communication (verbal and non-verbal), social skills, and repetitive behaviors. Typically, autism spectrum disorder is diagnosed in a clinical environment by licensed specialists using procedures which can be lengthy and cost-ineffective. Therefore, scholars in the medical, psychology, and applied behavioral science fields have in recent decades developed screening methods such as the Autism Spectrum Quotient and Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers for diagnosing autism and other pervasive developmental disorders. The accuracy and efficiency of these screening methods rely primarily on the experience and knowledge of the user, as well as the items designed in the screening method. One promising direction to improve the accuracy and efficiency of autism spectrum disorder detection is to build classification systems using intelligent technologies such as machine learning. Machine learning offers advanced techniques that construct automated classifiers that can be exploited by users and clinicians to significantly improve sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and efficiency in diagnostic discovery. This article proposes a new machine learning method called Rules-Machine Learning that not only detects autistic traits of cases and controls but also offers users knowledge bases (rules) that can be utilized by domain experts in understanding the reasons behind the classification. Empirical results on three data sets related to children, adolescents, and adults show that Rules-Machine Learning offers classifiers with higher predictive accuracy, sensitivity, harmonic mean, and specificity than those of other machine learning approaches such as Boosting, Bagging, decision trees, and rule induction.

**Journal:** *Insights into imaging*

*abstract:* This Strategic Research Agenda identifies current challenges and needs in healthcare, illustrates how biomedical imaging and derived data can help to address these, and aims to stimulate dedicated research funding efforts.Medicine is currently moving towards a more tailored, patient-centric approach by providing personalised solutions for the individual patient. Innovation in biomedical imaging plays a key role in this process as it addresses the current needs for individualised prevention, treatment, therapy response monitoring, and image-guided surgery.The use of non-invasive biomarkers facilitates better therapy prediction and monitoring, leading to improved patient outcomes. Innovative diagnostic imaging technologies provide information about disease characteristics which, coupled with biological, genetic and -omics data, will contribute to an individualised diagnosis and therapy approach.In the emerging field of theranostics, imaging tools together with therapeutic agents enable the selection of best treatments and allow tailored therapeutic interventions.For prenatal monitoring, the use of innovative imaging technologies can ensure an early detection of malfunctions or disease.The application of biomedical imaging for diagnosis and management of lifestyle-induced diseases will help to avoid disease development through lifestyle changes.Artificial intelligence and machine learning in imaging will facilitate the improvement of image interpretation and lead to better disease prediction and therapy planning.As biomedical imaging technologies and analysis of existing imaging data provide solutions to current challenges and needs in healthcare, appropriate funding for dedicated research is needed to implement the innovative approaches for the wellbeing of citizens and patients.

**Journal:** *Bioinformatics and biology insights*

*abstract:* Computational approaches to high-throughput data are gaining importance because of explosion of sequences in the post-genomic era. This explosion of sequence data creates a huge gap among the domains of sequence structure and function, since the experimental techniques to determine the structure and function are very expensive, time taking, and laborious in nature. Therefore, there is an urgent need to emphasize on the development of computational approaches in the field of biological systems. Engagement of proteins in quaternary arrangements, such as domain swapping, might be relevant for higher compatibility of such genes at stress conditions. In this study, the capacity to engage in domain swapping was predicted from mere sequence information in the whole genome of holy Basil (

**Journal:** *Evolutionary bioinformatics online*

*abstract:* Recent studies reveal that even the smallest genomes such as viruses evolve through complex and stochastic processes, and the assumption of independent alleles is not valid in most applications. Advances in sequencing technologies produce multiple time-point whole-genome data, which enable potential interactions between these alleles to be investigated empirically. To investigate these interactions, we represent alleles as distributed vectors that encode for relationships with other alleles in the course of evolution and apply artificial neural networks to time-sampled whole-genome datasets for feature learning. We build this platform using methods and algorithms derived from natural language processing (NLP), and we denote it as the nucleotide skip-gram neural network. We learn distributed vectors of alleles using the changes in allele frequency of echovirus 11 in the presence or absence of the disinfectant (ClO

#### [19. Data-Driven Subtyping of Parkinson's Disease Using Longitudinal Clinical Records: A Cohort Study.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-37545-z){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Zhang Xi, Chou Jingyuan, Liang Jian, Xiao Cao, Zhao Yize, Sarva Harini, Henchcliffe Claire, Wang Fei*

**Journal:** *Scientific reports*

*abstract:* Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with diverse clinical manifestations including motor and non-motor signs and symptoms, and emerging biomarkers. We aimed to reveal the heterogeneity of PD to define subtypes and their progression rates using an automated deep learning algorithm on the top of longitudinal clinical records. This study utilizes the data collected from the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), which is a longitudinal cohort study of patients with newly diagnosed Parkinson's disease. Clinical information including motor and non-motor assessments, biospecimen examinations, and neuroimaging results were used for identification of PD subtypes. A deep learning algorithm, Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), was used to represent each patient as a multi-dimensional time series for subtype identification. Both visualization and statistical analysis were performed for analyzing the obtained PD subtypes. As a result, 466 patients with idiopathic PD were investigated and three subtypes were identified. Subtype I (Mild Baseline, Moderate Motor Progression) is comprised of 43.1% of the participants, with average age 58.79 ± 9.53 years, and was characterized by moderate functional decay in motor ability but stable cognitive ability. Subtype II (Moderate Baseline, Mild Progression) is comprised of 22.9% of the participants, with average age 61.93 ± 6.56 years, and was characterized by mild functional decay in both motor and non-motor symptoms. Subtype III (Severe Baseline, Rapid Progression) is comprised 33.9% of the patients, with average age 65.32 ± 8.86 years, and was characterized by rapid progression of both motor and non-motor symptoms. These subtypes suggest that when comprehensive clinical and biomarker data are incorporated into a deep learning algorithm, the disease progression rates do not necessarily associate with baseline severities, and the progression rate of non-motor symptoms is not necessarily correlated with the progression rate of motor symptoms.

**Authors:** *Vu Hoang Lan, Ng Kelvin Tsun Wai, Bolingbroke Damien*

**Journal:** *Waste management (New York, N.Y.)*

*abstract:* Efficient and effective solid waste management requires sufficient ability to predict the operational capacity of a system correctly. Waste prediction models have been widely studied and these models are always being challenged to perform more accurately. Unlike waste prediction models for mixed wastes, variables for yard waste are time sensitive and the effects of lag must be explicitly considered. This study is the first to specifically look at lag times relating to variables that attempt to predict municipal yard waste generation using machine learning approaches. Weekly averaged climatic and socio-economic variables are screened through correlation analysis and the significant variables are then used to develop yard waste models. These models then utilize artificial neural networks (ANN) where the variables are time lagged for a different number of weeks. This helps to realize a reduction in the error of the predicted weekly yard waste generation. Optimal lag times for each model varied from 1 to 11 weeks. The best model used both the ambient air temperature and population variables, in an ANN model with 3 layers, 11 neurons in the hidden layer, and an optimal lag time of 1 week. A mean absolute percentage error of 18.72% was obtained during the testing stage. One model saw a 55.4% decrease in the mean squared error at training, showing the value of lag time on the accuracy of weekly yard waste prediction models.

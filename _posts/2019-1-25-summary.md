Connectomics has proved promising in quantifying and understanding the effects of
development, aging and an array of diseases on the brain. In this work, we
propose a new structural connectivity measure from diffusion MRI that allows us
to incorporate direct brain connections, as well as indirect ones that would not 
be otherwise accounted for by standard techniques and that may be key for the
better understanding of function from structure. From our experiments on the
Human Connectome Project dataset, we find that our measure of structural
connectivity better correlates with functional connectivity than streamline
tractography does, meaning that it provides new structural information related to
function. Through additional experiments on the ADNI-2 dataset, we demonstrate
the ability of this new measure to better discriminate different stages of
Alzheimer's disease. Our findings suggest that this measure is useful in the
study of the normal brain structure, and for quantifying the effects of disease
on the brain structure.

Environmental information is acquired and assessed during the environmental
impact assessment process for surface-strip coal mine approval. However,
integrating these data and quantifying rehabilitation risk using a holistic
multi-disciplinary approach is seldom undertaken. We present a rehabilitation
risk assessment integrated network (R2 AIN™) framework, that can be applied using
Bayesian networks (BNs), to integrate and quantify such rehabilitation risks. Our
framework has seven steps, including key integration of rehabilitation risk
sources and the quantification of undesired rehabilitation risk events to the
final application of mitigation. We demonstrate the framework using a soil
compaction Bayesian network (BN) case study in the Witbank Coalfield, South
Africa and the Bowen Basin, Australia. Our approach allows for a probabilistic
assessment of rehabilitation risk associated with multi-disciplines to be
integrated and quantified. Using this method, a site's rehabilitation risk
profile can be determined before mining activities commence and the effects of
manipulating management actions during later mine phases to reduce risk, can be
gauged, to aid decision making. This article is protected by copyright. All

BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis of skin cancer lesions by dermoscopy, the gold
standard in dermatological imaging, calls for a diagnostic upscale. The aim of
the study was to improve the accuracy of dermoscopic skin cancer diagnosis
through use of novel deep learning (DL) algorithms. An additional
sonification-derived diagnostic layer was added to the visual classification to
increase sensitivity.
METHODS: Two parallel studies were conducted: a laboratory retrospective study
(LABS, n = 482 biopsies) and a non-interventional prospective observational study
(OBS, n = 63 biopsies). A training data set of biopsy-verified reports, normal
and cancerous skin lesions (n = 3954), were used to develop a DL classifier
exploring visual features (System A). The outputs of the classifier were
sonified, i.e. data conversion into sound (System B). Derived sound files were
analyzed by a second machine learning classifier, either as raw audio (LABS, OBS)
or following conversion into spectrograms (LABS) and by image analysis and human 
heuristics (OBS). The OBS criteria outcomes were System A specificity and System 
B sensitivity as raw sounds, spectrogram areas or heuristics.
FINDINGS: LABS employed dermoscopies, half benign half malignant, and compared
the accuracy of Systems A and B. System A algorithm resulted in a ROC AUC of
0.976 (95% CI, 0.965-0.987). Secondary machine learning analysis of raw sound,
FFT and Spectrogram ROC curves resulted in AUC's of 0.931 (95% CI 0.881-0.981),
0.90 (95% CI 0.838-0.963) and 0.988 (CI 95% 0.973-1.001), respectively. OBS
analysis of raw sound dermoscopies by the secondary machine learning resulted in 
a ROC AUC of 0.819 (95% CI, 0.7956 to 0.8406). OBS image analysis of AUC for
spectrograms displayed a ROC AUC of 0.808 (CI 95% 0.6945 To 0.9208). By applying 
a heuristic analysis of Systems A and B a sensitivity of 86% and specificity of
91% were derived in the clinical study.
INTERPRETATION: Adding a second stage of processing, which includes a deep
learning algorithm of sonification and heuristic inspection with machine
learning, significantly improves diagnostic accuracy. A combined two-stage system
is expected to assist clinical decisions and de-escalate the current trend of
over-diagnosis of skin cancer lesions as pathological. FUND: Bostel Technologies.

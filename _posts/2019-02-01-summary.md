Colorectal cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors, and its incidence
and mortality are increasing year by year in China. In 2018, for the first time, 
the FIT-DNA test was written into the expert consensus as the recommended
screening technology in China. As the core technology of colorectal cancer
screening, colonoscopy for right colon cancer is further supported. With the
application of artificial intelligence technology in colonoscopy, the efficiency 
and accuracy of screening will be greatly improved. New screening technologies
represented by circulating tumor cell (CTC) and individualized screening programs
based on molecular genetics are future directions. As the core of colorectal
cancer treatment, surgery has become quite mature. Traditional laparoscopic
surgery has become an optimal choice for colorectal cancer surgery. Open surgery,
robotic surgery and single-incision laparoscopic surgery have not been found
superior to multiport laparoscopic surgery. The focus of surgical research is to 
precisely select surgical methods, and to protect normal physiological function
of patients. For example, in order to reduce complications and improve quality of
life in patients undergoing rectal cancer surgery after neoadjuvant radiotherapy,
the "Tianhe surgery" was invented by the authors' team. Chemotherapy as the basis
of colorectal cancer treatment has shown good results in many aspects: The
PRODIGE-7 trial has confirmed that systemic chemotherapy is more important for
colorectal peritoneal metastasis after high quality cytoreductive surgery (CRS). 
While the addition of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) with
oxaliplatin does not result in the better overall survival (OS), but increases
the risk of postoperative complications. The FOWARC study has found that the
FOLFOX regimen (oxaliplatin and fluorouracil) achieved a 3-year disease-free
survival (DFS) rate similar to that of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, challenging
the clinical value of radiotherapy. Although several studies have confirmed that 
total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT) can improve pathological complete response (pCR) 
rate and DFS of patients with colorectal cancer, we do not recommend unretricted 
expansion of chemotherapy. How to combine the clinical characteristics and
molecular biological markers to select high-risk groups for chemotherapy, and how
to use personalized medicine according to the genetic characteristics of
patients, are also hot spots of current research. Immunotherapy is a game-changer
in all aspects of colorectal cancer. In order to adapt to the immune therapy, the
efficacy evaluation standard of solid tumors (iRECIST) has been revised. Immune
score could redefine tumor clinical staging system. Both the Checkmate-142 study 
for advanced tumors and the NCT03026140 study on neoadjuvant treatment for early 
tumors showed promising results. Although no significant progress has been seen
in the EGFR-targeted therapy and VEGFR-targeted therapy, new targeted drugs such 
as Eltanexor (ETLA, kpt -8602) and cobimetinib (MEK inhibitor) have been found to
be effective in clinical studies. According to the detection results of
tumor-related signaling pathways in patients, cross-guidance selection of
targeted drug therapy is also the direction of research. Although the IWWD
research results give a big blow to the "watch and wait" strategy, with the
exploration of TNT plan, more accurate imaging efficacy evaluation and the
application of immunotherapy, the "watch and wait" strategy will also receive new
attention. In recent years, we have seen the rapid development of artificial
intelligence technology. Although it is still in the exploratory stage in the
field of medicine, it will certainly reshape all aspects of colorectal cancer
diagnosis and treatment in the future, leading the research direction.

The treatment planning process for patients with head and neck (H&N) cancer is
regarded as one of the most complicated due to large target volume, multiple
prescription dose levels, and many radiation-sensitive critical structures near
the target. Treatment planning for this site requires a high level of human
expertise and a tremendous amount of effort to produce personalized high quality 
plans, taking as long as a week, which deteriorates the chances of tumor control 
and patient survival. To solve this problem, we propose to investigate a deep
learning-based dose prediction model, Hierarchically Densely Connected U-net,
based on two highly popular network architectures: U-net and DenseNet. We find
that this new architecture is able to accurately and efficiently predict the dose
distribution, outperforming the other two models, the Standard U-net and
DenseNet, in homogeneity, dose conformity, and dose coverage on the test data.
Averaging across all organs at risk, our proposed model is capable of predicting 
the organ-at-risk max dose within 6.3% and mean dose within 5.1% of the
prescription dose on the test data. The other models, the Standard U-net and
DenseNet, performed worse, having an averaged organ-at-risk max dose prediction
error of 8.2% and 9.3%, respectively, and averaged mean dose prediction error of 
6.4% and 6.8%, respectively. In addition, our proposed model used 12 times less
trainable parameters than the Standard U-net, and predicted the patient dose 4
times faster than DenseNet.

Medical accessibility is an important indicator for evaluating the effectiveness 
of public health services. However, the previous medical accessibility studies
mainly focus on spatial accessibility without considering temporal variation in
population distribution which is significant for evaluating access to emergency
medical service (EMS). This paper proposes a model of spatio-temporal
accessibility to EMS called ST-E2SFCA based on adapting the enhanced two-step
floating catchment area (E2SFCA) method. We apply our method to the greater Tokyo
area for a large volume of GPS dataset with millions of users and compare the
accessibility difference over space and time. To evaluate our model, we also
analyze the distinction of our model over different weight sets and compare the
performance of ST-E2SFCA with the traditional E2SFCA. The result shows that our
method can illustrate the temporal difference and is suitable for measuring the
spatio-temporal accessibility to EMS, thus can guide the hospital location
selection and urban planning.

Cell Junction Proteins-Mimetic Artificial Nanochannel System: Basic Logic Gates
Implemented by Nanofluidic Diodes.

Wang Y, Zhai J.

Inspired by communication modes of cell junction proteins, artificial bi-channel 
nanofluidic diodes system was constructed and investigated to implement basic
"AND" and "OR" logic gates in different connection modes. Input conditions were
set as conducting and non-conducting states of each nanofluidic diode unit.
Output results were set as response current of the system at rated voltage.
Besides, nanofluidic diodes with different ionic permeability were connected in
multiple modes and different logic operation results were obtained. This novel
logic device based on nanofluidic diodes provided a new approach to establish
diverse stimuli-responsive signals processing networks, and have prospect to
obtain nanofluidic diodes intelligence chips by integrating in large scale.

Deep learning neural network models such as multilayer perceptron (MLP) and
convolutional neural network (CNN) are novel and attractive artificial
intelligence computing tools. However, evaluation of the performance of these
methods is not readily available for practitioners yet. We provide a tutorial for
evaluating classification accuracy for various state-of-the-art learning
approaches, including familiar shallow and deep learning methods. For qualitative
response variables with more than two categories, many traditional accuracy
measures such as sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating 
characteristic curve are not applicable and we have to consider their extensions 
properly. In this paper, a few important statistical concepts for multicategory
classification accuracy are reviewed and their utilities for various learning
algorithms are demonstrated with real medical examples. We offer problem-based R 
code to illustrate how to perform these statistical computations step by step. We
expect that such analysis tools will become more familiar to practitioners and
receive broader applications in biostatistics.

This paper examines the ethical pitfalls and challenges that non-ethicists, such 
as researchers and programmers in the fields of computer science, artificial
intelligence and robotics, face when building moral machines. Whether ethics is
"computable" depends on how programmers understand ethics in the first place and 
on the adequacy of their understanding of the ethical problems and methodological
challenges in these fields. Researchers and programmers face at least two types
of problems due to their general lack of ethical knowledge or expertise. The
first type is so-called rookie mistakes, which could be addressed by providing
these people with the necessary ethical knowledge. The second, more difficult
methodological issue concerns areas of peer disagreement in ethics, where no easy
solutions are currently available. This paper examines several existing
approaches to highlight the ethical pitfalls and challenges involved. Familiarity
with these and similar problems can help programmers to avoid pitfalls and build 
better moral machines. The paper concludes that ethical decisions regarding moral
robots should be based on avoiding what is immoral (i.e. prohibiting certain
immoral actions) in combination with a pluralistic ethical method of solving
moral problems, rather than relying on a particular ethical approach, so as to
avoid a normative bias.

A unifying computational model of decision making.

Kirsch A(1).

Author information: 
(1), Stuttgart, Germany. ak@alexkirsch.de.

Decision making has long been of interest as a descriptive phenomenon in
psychology and as a generative one in artificial intelligence. Research ranges
from general, descriptive models of heuristic decision making to detailed studies
of decision parameters. This paper introduces a model that formalizes and
integrates several descriptive models so that it can serve both as a framework
for psychological models and as an algorithm for computational decision making.
We set special focus on the instantiation of this model with respect to
aggregating cue values by reviewing some methods from the field of computational 
social choice. To show its applicability in the context of artificial
intelligence we present a case study of computational problem solving.

BACKGROUND: Carotid artery intima-media thickness (cIMT) progression is a
surrogate marker of atherosclerosis with a high predictive value for future CVD
risk. This study evaluates the comparative efficacies of lipid lowering,
hypoglycemic, antihypertensive and antiplatelet medications on cIMT progression.
METHODS: We conducted a network meta-analysis (NMA) to evaluate the relative
efficacies of several drug classes in modifying cIMT progression. After a
literature search in several electronic databases, studies were selected by
following predetermined eligibility criteria. An inverse variance-heterogeneity
model was used for NMA. Sensitivity analyses were performed to check the
reliability of the overall NMA, and transitivity analyses were performed to
examine the effects of modifiers on the NMA outcomes.
RESULTS: Data were taken from 47 studies (15,721 patients; age: 60.2 years [95%
confidence interval (CI) 58.8, 61.6]; BMI: 27.2 kg/m2 [95% CI 26.4, 28.0]; and
gender: 58.3% males [95% CI 48.3, 68.3]). Treatment duration was 25.8 months [95%
CI 22.9, 28.7]. Of the 13 drug classes in the network, treatment with
phosphodiesterase III inhibitors was the most effective in retarding annual mean 
cIMT against network placebo (weighted mean difference (WMD) - 0.059 mm [95% CI
- 0.099, - 0.020) followed by the calcium channel blockers (WMD - 0.055 mm [95%
CI - 0.099, 0.001]) and platelet adenosine diphosphate inhibitors (WMD - 0.033 mm
[95% CI - 0.058, 0.008]). These 3 drug classes also attained the same positions
when the NMA was conducted by using first-year changes in mean cIMT. In
transitivity analyses, longer treatment duration, higher body mass index (BMI),
and a higher baseline cIMT were found to be independently associated with a
lesser reduction in annual mean cIMT. However, in a multivariate analysis with
these 3 modifiers, none of these factors was significantly associated with annual
change in mean cIMT. In the placebo group, age was inversely associated with
annual change in mean cIMT independently.
CONCLUSION: Phosphodiesterase III inhibitors and calcium channel blockers are
found more effective than other drug classes in retarding cIMT progression. Age, 
BMI, and baseline cIMT may have some impact on these outcomes.

The study aims to explore the spatial distribution of multi-tendinous muscle
modulated by central nervous system (CNS) during sustained contraction. Nine
subjects were recruited to trace constant target forces with right index finger
extension. Surface electromyography (sEMG) of extensor digitorum (ED) were
recorded with a 32-channel electrode array. Nine successive topographic maps (TM)
were obtained. Pixel wise analysis was utilized to extract subtracted topographic
maps (STM), which exhibited inhomogeneous distribution. STMs were characterized
into hot, warm, and cool regions corresponding to higher, moderate, and lower
change ranges, respectively. The relative normalized area (normalized to the
first phase) of these regions demonstrated different changing trends as rising,
plateauing, and falling over time, respectively. Moreover, the duration of these 
trends were found to be affected by force level. The rising/falling periods were 
longer at lower force levels, while the plateau can be achieved from the initial 
phase for higher force output (45% maximal voluntary contraction). The results
suggested muscle activity reorganization in ED plays a role to maintain sustained
contraction. Furthermore, the decreased dynamical regulation ability to spatial
reorganization may be prone to induce fatigue. This finding implied that spatial 
reorganization of muscle activity as a regulation mechanism contribute to
maintain constant force production.

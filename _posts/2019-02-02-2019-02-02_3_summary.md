#### [1. A rule-based semantic approach for data integration, standardization and dimensionality reduction utilizing the UMLS: Application to predicting bariatric surgery outcomes.](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0010-4825(19)30019-8){: .btn}

*abstract:* Utilization of existing clinical data for improving patient outcomes poses a number of challenging and complex problems involving lack of data integration, the absence of standardization across inhomogeneous data sources and computationally-demanding and time-consuming exploration of very large datasets. In this paper, we will present a robust semantic data integration, standardization and dimensionality reduction method to tackle and solve these problems. Our approach enables the integration of clinical data from diverse sources by resolving canonical inconsistencies and semantic heterogeneity as required by the National Library of Medicine's Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) to produce standardized medical data. Through a combined application of rule-based semantic networks and machine learning, our approach enables a large reduction in dimensionality of the data and thus allows for fast and efficient application of data mining techniques to large clinical datasets. An example application of the techniques developed in our study is presented for the prediction of bariatric surgery outcomes.

**Journal:** *The Science of the total environment*

*abstract:* Landslides are major hazards for human activities often causing great damage to human lives and infrastructure. Therefore, the main aim of the present study is to evaluate and compare three machine learning algorithms (MLAs) including Naïve Bayes (NB), radial basis function (RBF) Classifier, and RBF Network for landslide susceptibility mapping (LSM) at Longhai area in China. A total of 14 landslide conditioning factors were obtained from various data sources, then the frequency ratio (FR) and support vector machine (SVM) methods were used for the correlation and selection the most important factors for modelling process, respectively. Subsequently, the resulting three models were validated and compared using some statistical metrics including area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) curve, and Friedman and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests The results indicated that the RBF Classifier model had the highest goodness-of-fit and performance based on the training and validation datasets. The results concluded that the RBF Classifier model outperformed and outclassed (AUROC = 0.881), the NB (AUROC = 0.872) and the RBF Network (AUROC = 0.854) models. The obtained results pointed out that the RBF Classifier model is a promising method for spatial prediction of landslide over the world.

#### [3. Machine Learning-based Development and Validation of a Scoring System for Screening High Risk Esophageal Varices.](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1542-3565(19)30072-2){: .btn}

**Journal:** *Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association*

*abstract:* Many patients with cirrhosis who undergo esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) screening for esophageal varices (EVs) are found to have no or only small EVs. Endoscopic screening for EVs is therefore a potentially deferrable procedure that increases patient risk and healthcare cost. We developed and validated a scoring system, based on readily-available data, to identify patients with EVs varices that need treatment.

#### [4. Effort-aware and just-in-time defect prediction with neural network.](http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0211359){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Qiao Lei, Wang Yan*

**Journal:** *PloS one*

*abstract:* Effort-aware just-in-time (JIT) defect prediction is to rank source code changes based on the likelihood of detects as well as the effort to inspect such changes. Accurate defect prediction algorithms help to find more defects with limited effort. To improve the accuracy of defect prediction, in this paper, we propose a deep learning based approach for effort-aware just-in-time defect prediction. The key idea of the proposed approach is that neural network and deep learning could be exploited to select useful features for defect prediction because they have been proved excellent at selecting useful features for classification and regression. First, we preprocess ten numerical metrics of code changes, and then feed them to a neural network whose output indicates how likely the code change under test contains bugs. Second, we compute the benefit cost ratio for each code change by dividing the likelihood by its size. Finally, we rank code changes according to their benefit cost ratio. Evaluation results on a well-known data set suggest that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on each of the subject projects. It improves the average recall and popt by 15.6% and 8.1%, respectively.

**Journal:** *European radiology*

*abstract:* Integrating multiple imaging modalities is crucial for MRI data interpretation. The purpose of this study is to determine whether a previously proposed multi-view approach can effectively integrate the histogram features from multi-parametric MRI and whether the selected features can offer incremental prognostic values over clinical variables.

**Authors:** *Vidal-Alaball Josep, Royo Fibla Dídac, Zapata Miguel A, Marin-Gomez Francesc X, Solans Fernandez Oscar*

**Journal:** *JMIR research protocols*

*abstract:* Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most important causes of blindness worldwide, especially in developed countries. In diabetic patients, periodic examination of the back of the eye using a nonmydriatic camera has been widely demonstrated to be an effective system to control and prevent the onset of DR. Convolutional neural networks have been used to detect DR, achieving very high sensitivities and specificities.

**Journal:** *The Laryngoscope*

*abstract:* One of the key challenges with big data is leveraging the complex network of information to yield useful clinical insights. The confluence of massive amounts of health data and a desire to make inferences and insights on these data has produced a substantial amount of interest in machine-learning analytic methods. There has been a drastic increase in the otolaryngology literature volume describing novel applications of machine learning within the past 5 years. In this timely contemporary review, we provide an overview of popular machine-learning techniques, and review recent machine-learning applications in otolaryngology-head and neck surgery including neurotology, head and neck oncology, laryngology, and rhinology. Investigators have realized significant success in validated models with model sensitivities and specificities approaching 100%. Challenges remain in the implementation of machine-learning algorithms. This may be in part the unfamiliarity of these techniques to clinician leaders on the front lines of patient care. Spreading awareness and confidence in machine learning will follow with further validation and proof-of-value analyses that demonstrate model performance superiority over established methods. We are poised to see a greater influx of machine-learning applications to clinical problems in otolaryngology-head and neck surgery, and it is prudent for providers to understand the potential benefits and limitations of these technologies.

**Journal:** *Japanese journal of radiology*

*abstract:* Deep learning has caused a third boom of artificial intelligence and great changes of diagnostic medical imaging systems such as radiology, pathology, retinal imaging, dermatology inspection, and endoscopic diagnosis will be expected in the near future. However, various attempts and new methods of deep learning have been proposed in recent years, and their progress is extremely fast. Therefore, at the initial stage when medical artificial intelligence papers were published, the artificial intelligence technology itself may be old technology or well-known general-purpose common technology. Therefore, the author has reviewed state-of-the-art computer vision papers and presentations of 2018 using deep learning technologies, which will have future clinical potentials selected from the point of view of a radiologist such as generative adversarial network, knowledge distillation, and general image data sets for supervised learning.

*abstract:* Preventive maintenance activities require a tool to be offline for long hour in order to perform the prescribed maintenance activities. Although preventive maintenance is crucial to ensure operational reliability and efficiency of the tool, long hour of preventive maintenance activities increases the cycle time of the semiconductor fabrication foundry (Fab). Therefore, this activity is usually performed when the incoming Work-in-Progress to the equipment is forecasted to be low. The current statistical forecasting approach has low accuracy because it lacks the ability to capture the time-dependent behavior of the Work-in-Progress. In this paper, we present a forecasting model that utilizes machine learning method to forecast the incoming Work-In-Progress. Specifically, our proposed model uses LSTM to forecast multistep ahead incoming Work-in-Progress prediction to an equipment group. The proposed model's prediction results were compared with the results of the current statistical forecasting method of the Fab. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed model performed better than the statistical forecasting method in both hit rate and Pearson's correlation coefficient,

## [22. Persistent Homology for the Quantitative Evaluation of Architectural Features in Prostate Cancer Histology.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-36798-y){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Lawson Peter, Sholl Andrew B, Brown J Quincy, Fasy Brittany Terese, Wenk Carola*

**Journal:** *Scientific reports*

*abstract:* The current system for evaluating prostate cancer architecture is the Gleason grading system which divides the morphology of cancer into five distinct architectural patterns, labeled 1 to 5 in increasing levels of cancer aggressiveness, and generates a score by summing the labels of the two most dominant patterns. The Gleason score is currently the most powerful prognostic predictor of patient outcomes; however, it suffers from problems in reproducibility and consistency due to the high intra-observer and inter-observer variability amongst pathologists. In addition, the Gleason system lacks the granularity to address potentially prognostic architectural features beyond Gleason patterns. We evaluate prostate cancer for architectural subtypes using techniques from topological data analysis applied to prostate cancer glandular architecture. In this work we demonstrate the use of persistent homology to capture architectural features independently of Gleason patterns. Specifically, using persistent homology, we compute topological representations of purely graded prostate cancer histopathology images of Gleason patterns 3,4 and 5, and show that persistent homology is capable of clustering prostate cancer histology into architectural groups through a ranked persistence vector. Our results indicate the ability of persistent homology to cluster prostate cancer histopathology images into unique groups with dominant architectural patterns consistent with the continuum of Gleason patterns. In addition, of particular interest, is the sensitivity of persistent homology to identify specific sub-architectural groups within single Gleason patterns, suggesting that persistent homology could represent a robust quantification method for prostate cancer architecture with higher granularity than the existing semi-quantitative measures. The capability of these topological representations to segregate prostate cancer by architecture makes them an ideal candidate for use as inputs to future machine learning approaches with the intent of augmenting traditional approaches with topological features for improved diagnosis and prognosis.

## [23. Unsupervised feature extraction of anterior chamber OCT images for ordering and classification.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-38136-8){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Amil Pablo, González Laura, Arrondo Elena, Salinas Cecilia, Guell J L, Masoller Cristina, Parlitz Ulrich*

**Journal:** *Scientific reports*

*abstract:* We propose an image processing method for ordering anterior chamber optical coherence tomography (OCT) images in a fully unsupervised manner. The method consists of three steps: Firstly we preprocess the images (filtering the noise, aligning and normalizing the resolution); secondly, a distance measure between images is computed for every pair of images; thirdly we apply a machine learning algorithm that exploits the distance measure to order the images in a two-dimensional plane. The method is applied to a large (~1000) database of anterior chamber OCT images of healthy subjects and patients with angle-closure and the resulting unsupervised ordering and classification is validated by two ophthalmologists.

## [24. Comparison of different smartphone cameras to evaluate conjunctival hyperaemia in normal subjects.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-37925-5){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Otero Carles, García-Porta Nery, Tabernero Juan, Pardhan Shahina*

**Journal:** *Scientific reports*

*abstract:* Despite the significant advantages that smartphones' cameras can provide in teleophthalmology and artificial intelligence applications, their use as black-box systems for clinical data acquisition, without adequate information of the quality of photographs can compromise data accuracy. The aim of this study is to compare the objective and subjective quantification of conjunctival redness in images obtained with calibrated and non-calibrated cameras, in different lighting conditions and optical magnifications. One hundred ninety-two pictures of the eye were taken in 4 subjects using 3 smartphone cameras{Bq, Iphone, Nexus}, 2 lighting levels{high 815 lx, low 122 lx} and 2 magnification levels{high 10x, low 6x}. Images were duplicated: one set was white balanced and color corrected (calibrated) and the other was left as it was. Each image was subjective and objectively evaluated. There were no significant differences in subjective evaluation in any of the conditions whereas many statistically significant main effects and interaction effects were shown for all the objective metrics. The clinician's evaluation was not affected by different cameras, lighting conditions or optical magnifications, demonstrating the effectiveness of the human eye's color constancy properties. However, calibration of a smartphone's camera is essential when extracting objective data from images.

**Journal:** *Scientific reports*

*abstract:* Predicting physical response of an artificially structured material is of particular interest for scientific and engineering applications. Here we use deep learning to predict optical response of artificially engineered nanophotonic devices. In addition to predicting forward approximation of transmission response for any given topology, this approach allows us to inversely approximate designs for a targeted optical response. Our Deep Neural Network (DNN) could design compact (2.6 × 2.6 μm

## [26. A PET Radiomics Model to Predict Refractory Mediastinal Hodgkin Lymphoma.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-37197-z){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Milgrom Sarah A, Elhalawani Hesham, Lee Joonsang, Wang Qianghu, Mohamed Abdallah S R, Dabaja Bouthaina S, Pinnix Chelsea C, Gunther Jillian R, Court Laurence, Rao Arvind, Fuller Clifton D, Akhtari Mani, Aristophanous Michalis, Mawlawi Osama, Chuang Hubert H, Sulman Erik P, Lee Hun J, Hagemeister Frederick B, Oki Yasuhiro, Fanale Michelle, Smith Grace L*

**Journal:** *Scientific reports*

*abstract:* First-order radiomic features, such as metabolic tumor volume (MTV) and total lesion glycolysis (TLG), are associated with disease progression in early-stage classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). We hypothesized that a model incorporating first- and second-order radiomic features would more accurately predict outcome than MTV or TLG alone. We assessed whether radiomic features extracted from baseline PET scans predicted relapsed or refractory disease status in a cohort of 251 patients with stage I-II HL who were managed at a tertiary cancer center. Models were developed and tested using a machine-learning algorithm. Features extracted from mediastinal sites were highly predictive of primary refractory disease. A model incorporating 5 of the most predictive features had an area under the curve (AUC) of 95.2% and total error rate of 1.8%. By comparison, the AUC was 78% for both MTV and TLG and was 65% for maximum standardize uptake value (SUV

## [27. Neurodevelopmental heterogeneity and computational approaches for understanding autism.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41398-019-0390-0){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Jacob Suma, Wolff Jason J, Steinbach Michael S, Doyle Colleen B, Kumar Vipan, Elison Jed T*

**Journal:** *Translational psychiatry*

*abstract:* In recent years, the emerging field of computational psychiatry has impelled the use of machine learning models as a means to further understand the pathogenesis of multiple clinical disorders. In this paper, we discuss how autism spectrum disorder (ASD) was and continues to be diagnosed in the context of its complex neurodevelopmental heterogeneity. We review machine learning approaches to streamline ASD's diagnostic methods, to discern similarities and differences from comorbid diagnoses, and to follow developmentally variable outcomes. Both supervised machine learning models for classification outcome and unsupervised approaches to identify new dimensions and subgroups are discussed. We provide an illustrative example of how computational analytic methods and a longitudinal design can improve our inferential ability to detect early dysfunctional behaviors that may or may not reach threshold levels for formal diagnoses. Specifically, an unsupervised machine learning approach of anomaly detection is used to illustrate how community samples may be utilized to investigate early autism risk, multidimensional features, and outcome variables. Because ASD symptoms and challenges are not static within individuals across development, computational approaches present a promising method to elucidate subgroups of etiological contributions to phenotype, alternative developmental courses, interactions with biomedical comorbidities, and to predict potential responses to therapeutic interventions.

## [28. Scaling up analogical innovation with crowds and AI.](http://www.pnas.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=30718420){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Kittur Aniket, Yu Lixiu, Hope Tom, Chan Joel, Lifshitz-Assaf Hila, Gilon Karni, Ng Felicia, Kraut Robert E, Shahaf Dafna*

**Journal:** *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America*

*abstract:* Analogy-the ability to find and apply deep structural patterns across domains-has been fundamental to human innovation in science and technology. Today there is a growing opportunity to accelerate innovation by moving analogy out of a single person's mind and distributing it across many information processors, both human and machine. Doing so has the potential to overcome cognitive fixation, scale to large idea repositories, and support complex problems with multiple constraints. Here we lay out a perspective on the future of scalable analogical innovation and first steps using crowds and artificial intelligence (AI) to augment creativity that quantitatively demonstrate the promise of the approach, as well as core challenges critical to realizing this vision.

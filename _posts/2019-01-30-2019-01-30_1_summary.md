*abstract:* An Artificial Intelligence system was developed and implemented for water, wastewater, and reuse plants to improve management of sensors, short and long-term maintenance plans, asset and investment management plans. It is based on an integrated approach to capture data from different computer systems and files. It adds a layer of intelligence to the data. It serves as a repository of key current and future operations and maintenance conditions that a plant needs have knowledge of. With this information, it can simulate the configuration of processes and assets for those conditions to improve or optimize operations, maintenance and asset management, using the IViewOps (Intelligent View of Operations) model. Based on the optimization through model runs, it is able to create output files that can feed data to other systems and inform the staff regarding optimal solutions to the conditions experienced or anticipated in the future.

*abstract:* Since the 1970s, the magnitude of turtle cold-stun strandings have increased dramatically within the northwestern Atlantic. Here, we examine oceanic, atmospheric, and biological factors that may affect the increasing trend of cold-stunned Kemp's ridleys in Cape Cod Bay, Massachusetts, United States of America. Using machine learning and Bayesian inference modeling techniques, we demonstrate higher cold-stunning years occur when the Gulf of Maine has warmer sea surface temperatures in late October through early November. Surprisingly, hatchling numbers in Mexico, a proxy for population abundance, was not identified as an important factor. Further, using our Bayesian count model and forecasted sea surface temperature projections, we predict more than 2,300 Kemp's ridley turtles may cold-stun annually by 2031 as sea surface temperatures continue to increase within the Gulf of Maine. We suggest warmer sea surface temperatures may have modified the northerly distribution of Kemp's ridleys and act as an ecological bridge between the Gulf Stream and nearshore waters. While cold-stunning may currently account for a minor proportion of juvenile mortality, we recommend continuing efforts to rehabilitate cold-stunned individuals to maintain population resiliency for this critically endangered species in the face of a changing climate and continuing anthropogenic threats.

## 3. Label-free classification of cells based on supervised machine learning of subcellular structures.


*Journal: PloS one* *Publication Date: 2019*

*abstract:* It is demonstrated that cells can be classified by pattern recognition of the subcellular structure of non-stained live cells, and the pattern recognition was performed by machine learning. Human white blood cells and five types of cancer cell lines were imaged by quantitative phase microscopy, which provides morphological information without staining quantitatively in terms of optical thickness of cells. Subcellular features were then extracted from the obtained images as training data sets for the machine learning. The built classifier successfully classified WBCs from cell lines (area under ROC curve = 0.996). This label-free, non-cytotoxic cell classification based on the subcellular structure of QPM images has the potential to serve as an automated diagnosis of single cells.

## 4. Using supervised learning to select audit targets in performance-based financing in health: An example from Zambia.


*Journal: PloS one* *Publication Date: 2019*

*abstract:* Independent verification is a critical component of performance-based financing (PBF) in health care, in which facilities are offered incentives to increase the volume of specific services but the same incentives may lead them to over-report. We examine alternative strategies for targeted sampling of health clinics for independent verification. Specifically, we empirically compare several methods of random sampling and predictive modeling on data from a Zambian PBF pilot that contains reported and verified performance for quantity indicators of 140 clinics. Our results indicate that machine learning methods, particularly Random Forest, outperform other approaches and can increase the cost-effectiveness of verification activities.

*abstract:* Concussion prevalence in Sport is well-recognized; so too is the challenge of clinical and return-to-play management for an injury with an inherent indeterminant time course of resolve. Clear, valid insight to the anticipated resolution time could assist in planning treatment intervention.

## 6. Deceleration, Acceleration, and Impacts Are Strong Contributors to Muscle Damage in Professional Australian Football.


*Journal: Journal of strength and conditioning research* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-23*

[http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000003023](http://dx.doi.org/10.1519/JSC.0000000000003023){: .btn}

*abstract:* Gastin, PB, Hunkin, SL, Fahrner, B, and Robertson, S. Deceleration, acceleration, and impacts are strong contributors to muscle damage in professional Australian football. J Strength Cond Res XX(X): 000-000, 2019-The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationships between serum creatine kinase [CK], an indirect marker of muscle damage, and specific indices of match load in elite Australian football. Twenty-six professional players were assessed during a competitive Australian Football League (AFL) season. [CK] was collected 24-36 hours before match and 34-40 hours after match during 8 in-season rounds. An athlete-tracking technology was used to quantify match load. Generalized estimating equations and random forest models were constructed to determine the extent to which match-load indices and pre-match [CK] explained post-match [CK]. There was a 129 ± 152% increase in [CK] in response to AFL competition. Generalized estimating equations found that number of impacts >3g (p = 0.004) and game time (p = 0.016) were most strongly associated with post-match [CK]. Random forest, with considerably lower errors (130 vs. 316 U·L), found deceleration, acceleration, impacts >3g, and sprint distance to be the strongest predictors. Pre-match [CK] accounted for 11% of post-match [CK], and considerable interindividual and intraindividual variability existed in the data. Creatine kinase, an indicator of muscle damage, was considerably elevated as a result of AFL competition. Parametric and machine-learning analysis techniques found several indices of physical load associated with muscle damage during competition, with impacts >3g and high-intensity running variables as the strongest predictors. [CK] may be used as a global measure of muscle damage in field team sports such as AF, yet with some caution given cost, invasiveness, and inherent variability. Quantifying physical load and the responses to that load can guide athlete management decision-making and is best undertaken within a suite of practical, sport-specific measures, where data are interpreted individually and with an understanding of the limitations.

*abstract:* Multiparametric high-content imaging assays have become established to classify cell phenotypes from functional genomic and small-molecule library screening assays. Several groups have implemented machine learning classifiers to predict the mechanism of action of phenotypic hit compounds by comparing the similarity of their high-content phenotypic profiles with a reference library of well-annotated compounds. However, the majority of such examples are restricted to a single cell type often selected because of its suitability for simple image analysis and intuitive segmentation of morphological features. The aim of the current study was to evaluate and compare the performance of a classic ensemble-based tree classifier trained on extracted morphological features and a deep learning classifier using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) trained directly on images from the same dataset to predict compound mechanism of action across a morphologically and genetically distinct cell panel. Our results demonstrate that application of a CNN classifier delivers equivalent accuracy compared with an ensemble-based tree classifier at compound mechanism of action prediction within cell lines. However, our CNN analysis performs worse than an ensemble-based tree classifier when trained on multiple cell lines at predicting compound mechanism of action on an unseen cell line.

## 8. Mechanistic Reactivity Descriptors for the Prediction of Ames Mutagenicity of Primary Aromatic Amines.


*Journal: Journal of chemical information and modeling* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-29*

[https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00758](https://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.8b00758){: .btn}

*abstract:* Pharmaceutical products are often synthesized by the use of reactive starting materials and intermediates. These can, either as impurities or through metabolic activation, bind to the DNA. Primary aromatic amines belong to the critical classes that are considered potentially mutagenic in the Ames test so there is a great need of good prediction models for risk assessment. How primary aromatic amines exert their mutagenic potential can be rationalized by the widely accepted nitrenium ion hypothesis of covalent binding to the DNA of reactive electrophiles formed out of the aromatic amines. Since the reactive chemical species is different in chemical structure from the actual compound it is difficult to achieve good predictions via classical descriptor or fingerprint-based machine learning. In this approach, we use a combination of different molecular and atomic descriptors that is able to describe different mechanistic aspects of the metabolic transformation leading from the primary aromatic amine to the reactive metabolite that binds to the DNA. Applied to a test set, the combination shows significantly better performances than models that only use one of these descriptors and complemented the general internal Ames mutagenicity prediction model at Bayer.

## 9. An X-ray computed micro-tomography dataset for oil removal from carbonate porous media.


*Journal: Scientific data* *Publication Date: 2019-Jan-29*

[http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2019.4](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2019.4){: .btn}

*abstract:* This study reveals the pore-scale details of oil mobilisation and recovery from a carbonate rock upon injection of aqueous nanoparticle (NP) suspensions. X-ray computed micro-tomography (μCT), which is a non-destructive imaging technique, was used to acquire a dataset which includes: (i) 3D images of the sample collected at the end of fluid injection steps, and (ii) 2D radiogram series collected during fluid injections. The latter allows monitoring fluid flow dynamics at time resolutions down to a few seconds using a laboratory-based μCT scanner. By making this dataset publicly available we enable (i) new image reconstruction algorithms to be tested on large images, (ii) further development of image segmentation algorithms based on machine learning, and (iii) new models for multi-phase fluid displacements in porous media to be evaluated using images of a dynamic process in a naturally occurring and complex material. This dataset is comprehensive in that it offers a series of images that were captured before/during/and after the immiscible fluid injections.

*abstract:* Food allergy is usually difficult to diagnose in early life, and the inability to diagnose patients with atopic diseases at an early age may lead to severe complications. Numerous studies have suggested an association between the infant gut microbiome and development of allergy. In this work, we investigated the capacity of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict food allergies in early life (0-3 years) from subjects' longitudinal gut microbiome profiles. Using the DIABIMMUNE dataset, we show an increase in predictive power using our model compared to Hidden Markov Model, Multi-Layer Perceptron Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, and LASSO regression. We further evaluated whether the training of LSTM networks benefits from reduced representations of microbial features. We considered sparse autoencoder for extraction of potential latent representations in addition to standard feature selection procedures based on Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) and variance prior to the training of LSTM networks. The comprehensive evaluation reveals that LSTM networks with the mRMR selected features achieve significantly better performance compared to the other tested machine learning models.

*abstract:* Comprehensive characterization of ligand-binding sites is invaluable to infer molecular functions of hypothetical proteins, trace evolutionary relationships between proteins, engineer enzymes to achieve a desired substrate specificity, and develop drugs with improved selectivity profiles. These research efforts pose significant challenges owing to the fact that similar pockets are commonly observed across different folds, leading to the high degree of promiscuity of ligand-protein interactions at the system-level. On that account, novel algorithms to accurately classify binding sites are needed. Deep learning is attracting a significant attention due to its successful applications in a wide range of disciplines. In this communication, we present DeepDrug3D, a new approach to characterize and classify binding pockets in proteins with deep learning. It employs a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network in which biomolecular structures are represented as voxels assigned interaction energy-based attributes. The current implementation of DeepDrug3D, trained to detect and classify nucleotide- and heme-binding sites, not only achieves a high accuracy of 95%, but also has the ability to generalize to unseen data as demonstrated for steroid-binding proteins and peptidase enzymes. Interestingly, the analysis of strongly discriminative regions of binding pockets reveals that this high classification accuracy arises from learning the patterns of specific molecular interactions, such as hydrogen bonds, aromatic and hydrophobic contacts. DeepDrug3D is available as an open-source program at https://github.com/pulimeng/DeepDrug3D with the accompanying TOUGH-C1 benchmarking dataset accessible from https://osf.io/enz69/.

*abstract:* The irregularity detection of daily behaviors for the elderly is an important issue in homecare. Plenty of mechanisms have been developed to detect the health condition of the elderly based on the explicit irregularity of several biomedical parameters or some specific behaviors. However, few researches focus on detecting the implicit irregularity involving the combination of diverse behaviors, which can assess the cognitive and physical wellbeing of elders but cannot be directly identified based on sensor data. This paper proposes an Implicit IRregularity Detection (IIRD) mechanism, which aims to detect the implicit irregularity by developing the unsupervised learning algorithm based on daily behaviors. The proposed IIRD mechanism identifies the distance and similarity between daily behaviors, which are important features to distinguish the regular and irregular daily behaviors and detect the implicit irregularity of elderly health condition. Performance results show that the proposed IIRD outperforms the existing unsupervised machine learning mechanisms in terms of the detection accuracy and irregularity recall.

*abstract:* Variable selection has attracted more attention in big data and machine learning fields. In high dimensional data analysis, many relevant variables or variable groups are widely found. For example, people pay more interests to biological pathway or regulatory network in microarray gene expression data. In recent years, regularization methods are commonly used approaches for variable selection. Existing regularization methods generally use L

*abstract:* Although traffic sign detection has been studied for years and great progress has been made with the rise of deep learning technique, there are still many problems remaining to be addressed. For complicated real-world traffic scenes, there are two main challenges. Firstly, traffic signs are usually smallsize objects, which makes it more difficult to detect than large ones; Secondly, it is hard to distinguish false targets which resemble real traffic signs in complex street scenes without context information. To handle these problems, we propose a novel end-to-end deep learning method for traffic sign detection in complex environments. Our contributions are as follows: 1) We propose a multi-resolution feature fusion network architecture which exploits densely connected deconvolution layers with skip connections, and can learn more effective features for smallsize object; 2) We frame the traffic sign detection as a spatial sequence classification and regression task, and propose a vertical spatial sequence attention (VSSA) module to gain more context information for better detection performance. To comprehensively evaluate the proposed method, we do experiments on several traffic sign datasets as well as the general object detection dataset and the results have shown the effectiveness of our proposed method.

*abstract:* Blockade of human ether-à-go-go-related gene (hERG) channel by small molecules induces the prolongation of the QT interval which leads to fatal cardiotoxicity, and accounts for the withdrawal or severe restrictions on the use of many approved drugs. In this study, we develop a deep learning approach, termed deephERG, for prediction of hERG blockers of small molecules in drug discovery and post-marketing surveillance. In total, we assemble 7,889 compounds with well-defined experimental data on the hERG and with diverse chemical structures. We find that deephERG models built by a multi-task deep neural network (DNN) algorithm outperform those built by single-task DNN, naïve Bayes (NB), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and graph convolutional neural network (GCNN). Specifically, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value for the best model of deephERG is 0.967 on the validation set. Furthermore, based on 1,824 U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs, 29.6% drugs are computationally identified to have potential hERG inhibitory activities by deephERG, highlighting the importance of hERG risk assessment in the early drug discovery. Finally, we showcase several novel predicted hERG blockers on approved antineoplastic agents, which are validated by clinical case reports, experimental evidences, and literatures. In summary, this study presents a powerful deep learning-based tool for risk assessment of hERG-mediated cardiotoxicities in drug discovery and post-marketing surveillance.

*abstract:* Social well-being reflects the perception of one's social functioning, which plays an important role in physical and psychological health. However, the exact neuroanatomical substrate for social well-being remains unclear. To address the issue, we employed the voxel-based morphometry (VBM) method to probe the neuroanatomical basis of individual variation in social well-being in young healthy adults (n =136). The results revealed a significant negative association between social well-being and regional gray matter density (rGMD) in an anatomical cluster that mainly includes the left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) that has been involved in emotion regulation and social cognition. Furthermore, a balanced 4-fold cross-validation using the machine learning approach revealed that rGMD in the left OFC could be reliably related to social well-being. More importantly, the multiple mediation analysis revealed that neuroticism and dispositional forgiveness independently mediated the association between rGMD in the left OFC and social well-being. In addition, all these results remained stable when subjective socioeconomic status was controlled. Together, our results provide the initial evidence that the OFC is a neuroanatomical substrate for social well-being and demonstrate that the OFC is a crucial neural site linking neuroticism and dispositional forgiveness to social well-being.

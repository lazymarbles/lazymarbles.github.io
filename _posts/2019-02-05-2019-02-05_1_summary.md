#### [31. Prediction of sepsis patients using machine learning approach: A meta-analysis.](https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169-2607(18)31602-X){: .btn}

*abstract:* Sepsis is a common and major health crisis in hospitals globally. An innovative and feasible tool for predicting sepsis remains elusive. However, early and accurate prediction of sepsis could help physicians with proper treatments and minimize the diagnostic uncertainty. Machine learning models could help to identify potential clinical variables and provide higher performance than existing traditional low-performance models. We therefore performed a meta-analysis of observational studies to quantify the performance of a machine learning model to predict sepsis.

#### [32. The International Conference on Intelligent Biology and Medicine (ICIBM) 2018: genomics with bigger data and wider applications.](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-018-5369-3){: .btn}

**Journal:** *BMC genomics*

*abstract:* The sixth International Conference on Intelligent Biology and Medicine (ICIBM) took place in Los Angeles, California, USA on June 10-12, 2018. This conference featured eleven regular scientific sessions, four tutorials, one poster session, four keynote talks, and four eminent scholar talks. The scientific program covered a wide range of topics from bench to bedside, including 3D Genome Organization, reconstruction of large scale evolution of genomes and gene functions, artificial intelligence in biological and biomedical fields, and precision medicine. Both method development and application in genomic research continued to be a main component in the conference, including studies on genetic variants, regulation of transcription, genetic-epigenetic interaction at both single cell and tissue level and artificial intelligence. Here, we write a summary of the conference and also briefly introduce the four high quality papers selected to be published in BMC Genomics that cover novel methodology development or innovative data analysis.

#### [33. Gene2vec: distributed representation of genes based on co-expression.](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12864-018-5370-x){: .btn}
**Authors:** *Du Jingcheng, Jia Peilin, Dai Yulin, Tao Cui, Zhao Zhongming, Zhi Degui*

**Journal:** *BMC genomics*

*abstract:* Existing functional description of genes are categorical, discrete, and mostly through manual process. In this work, we explore the idea of gene embedding, distributed representation of genes, in the spirit of word embedding.
